SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 1. [Workshop\
 , Intermediate]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Urs Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer a
 nd JetBrains certified Kotlin Trainer \n\nIf you want to get the most out 
 of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, high-throughput\, and resource ef
 ficiency\, there is no way around virtual threads and/or reactive librarie
 s like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t get you far: Virtual threads are l
 imited to non-blocking operations\, and WebFlux — even though offering all 
 reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — 
 will give you a lot of headaches due to its complexity\, bad readability\, 
 and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop\, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s 
 coroutine support will wipe out all the downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux app
 roach or the limitations of virtual threads and provide you with the best 
 of both worlds: non-blocking reactive characteristics without the complexi
 ty.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will explore Kotlin’s reactive building bl
 ocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, and apply them in Spring Boot. By bu
 ilding a non-blocking API in Spring Boot from scratch\, you’ll learn how t
 o:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux and/or virtual threads.\n- Perfor
 m non-blocking remote API calls using WebClient or RestClient.\n- Access a 
 database in a reactive way\, either via the R2DBC or JDBC\, including fram
 ework support.\n- Apply structured concurrency in your business logic\, li
 ke requesting data in parallel.\n- Create an advanced streaming API based 
 on ServerSentEvents that combines coroutines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we 
 will explore virtual threads in-depth and see how they can leverage the po
 wer of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the end of the workshop\, you’ll know a
 ll the ins and outs of programming in Spring Boot with coroutines while ha
 ving experienced the tremendous benefits they offer over raw virtual threa
 ds or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge you gain\, you can enlighten your Spr
 ing Boot project with coroutines the very next day.\n

DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Jolan Rensen - Kotlin Data Science (Moonshots) T
 eam Member at JetBrains\n    Aleksei Zinovev - JetBrains\, TeamLead in Kot
 lin for Data Science\n\nThis workshop is designed for all Kotlin developer
 s who need simple and convenient tools within their native ecosystem to as
 sist them when working with data\, understanding its nature\, performing a
 ny necessary processing\, and presenting the results to their team or stak
 eholders as a report or chart.\n\nIn this workshop\, you’ll learn how to b
 uild data processing pipelines in your applications. We’ll explore the bes
 t practices for extracting data from various sources\, aggregating and tra
 nsforming it\, and then exporting it as a collection of data classes\, dis
 playing it as tables\, or visualizing it with insightful charts.\n\nBy the

 t data using the Kotlin DataFrame library.\n- Visualize data with the Kand
 y library to effectively convey insights.\n- Access and manipulate data fr
 om various sources: REST APIs\, SQL databases\, CSV files\, and other tabu
 lar data.\n- Handle both flat and hierarchical JSON-like data structures.\
 n- Boost your code written with the help of the kotlin.collections or SQL-
 like frameworks.\n- Solve practical problems by applying your skills to th
 ree real-world scenarios.\n- Present the insights in Kotlin notebooks and

 Simon Vergauwen - Developer Advocate at JetBrains & OSS (arrow-kt) Maintai
 ner\n    Leonid Stashevskii - JetBrains\n\nKtor is a lightweight and flexi
 ble toolkit for building HTTP applications. This workshop will use the Kot
 lin programming language\, the Ktor framework\, the Exposed database acces
 s library\, OpenAI\, and several other Kotlin and Java libraries to build 
 a feature-complete AI powered web application.\n\nWe’ll start with the bas
 ics by exploring the Ktor framework and learning how to build a simple web 
 application using essential functions. We’ll cover topics like handling HT
 TP requests\, working with WebSockets\, database access\, authentication\, 
 logging\, and deployment.\n\nFor testing\, we will look into the APIs that 
 Ktor provides. Finally\, we will explore the API for writing plugins and u
 se it to create a simple plugin for our Ktor application.\n\nBy the end of 
 the workshop\, you’ll be able to:\n  - Structure Ktor projects\n  - Test K
 tor applications\n  - Create and deploy RESTful services using Ktor\n  - I
 ntegrate Ktor with external libraries\n\nThis will be a fast-paced worksho

SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 3. [Workshop\
 , Intermediate]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Urs Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer a
 nd JetBrains certified Kotlin Trainer \n\nIf you want to get the most out 
 of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, high-throughput\, and resource ef
 ficiency\, there is no way around virtual threads and/or reactive librarie
 s like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t get you far: Virtual threads are l
 imited to non-blocking operations\, and WebFlux — even though offering all 
 reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — 
 will give you a lot of headaches due to its complexity\, bad readability\, 
 and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop\, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s 
 coroutine support will wipe out all the downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux app
 roach or the limitations of virtual threads and provide you with the best 
 of both worlds: non-blocking reactive characteristics without the complexi
 ty.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will explore Kotlin’s reactive building bl
 ocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, and apply them in Spring Boot. By bu
 ilding a non-blocking API in Spring Boot from scratch\, you’ll learn how t
 o:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux and/or virtual threads.\n- Perfor
 m non-blocking remote API calls using WebClient or RestClient.\n- Access a 
 database in a reactive way\, either via the R2DBC or JDBC\, including fram
 ework support.\n- Apply structured concurrency in your business logic\, li
 ke requesting data in parallel.\n- Create an advanced streaming API based 
 on ServerSentEvents that combines coroutines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we 
 will explore virtual threads in-depth and see how they can leverage the po
 wer of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the end of the workshop\, you’ll know a
 ll the ins and outs of programming in Spring Boot with coroutines while ha
 ving experienced the tremendous benefits they offer over raw virtual threa
 ds or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge you gain\, you can enlighten your Spr
 ing Boot project with coroutines the very next day.\n

SUMMARY:A (deep) dive into (shallow) immutability: Valhalla and beyond [Reg
 ular session\, Intermediate\, Language and best practices\, Other]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Marat Akhin - Researcher @ Kotlin Language Evolu
 tion\, JetBrains\n\nImmutability is getting more and more attention in mod
 ern programming\, making code easier to reason about\, safer in concurrent 
 environments\, and more maintainable. However\, adopting immutability isn’
 t without challenges\, as it does improve the developer experience\, but c
 an often come with runtime costs. In Kotlin\, immutability is already a ke
 y part of the language design\, but there’s significant potential to push 
 its boundaries even further.\n\nThis talk begins by exploring the current 
 state of immutability in Kotlin. We’ll highlight what features the languag
 e already provides\, examine what’s missing\, and discuss the reasons behi
 nd these design decisions. From there\, we’ll take a closer look at Projec
 t Valhalla\, an upcoming JVM initiative that introduces value types and ot
 her innovations\, enabling new possibilities for Kotlin. We’ll discuss how 
 Valhalla can help enhance Kotlin’s immutability story and improve the prog
 ramming experience without significant trade-offs.\n\nFinally\, we’ll expl
 ore the broader immutability design space for Kotlin\, looking beyond Valh
 alla to imagine what future extensions could look like. We’ll discuss how 
 new immutability features could integrate with existing ones\, such as sma
 rt casts and coroutines\, while maintaining the language’s pragmatic and d
 eveloper-friendly nature.\n\nJoin this session to discover how Kotlin can 
 evolve its immutability story to better meet the needs of modern developer
 s\, combining practicality with innovation.\n

SUMMARY:Extending Ktor for Server Side Development [Regular session\, Inter
 mediate\, Server-side]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Ido Flax - Senior Backend Engineer and open sour
 ce entrepreneur \n\nWhile Kotlin is seeing widespread adoption for Server 
 side development\, Ktor\, Kotlin's minimalistic and flexible framework for 
 server and client side development\, is sometimes overlooked\, largely bec
 ause Spring Boot still offers an exhaustive range of starters. \n\nTo brid
 ge this gap\, kotlin developers can utilise Ktor's fluent Plugin API to pr
 ovide all the functionality they need for their own use cases\, and those 
 of the wider community.\n\nIn this session\, we will discuss developing pl
 ugins for Ktor and demonstrate a few interesting plugins that complement t
 he standard set of Ktor’s features.\n\nYou’ll learn how to seamlessly inte
 grate essential functionalities like Kafka for message-driven architecture
 s\, implement advanced rate limiting for traffic control\, and enhance sys
 tem resilience with a sophisticated Circuit Breaker plugin. Each plugin is 
 crafted to offer flexibility and ease of integration\, making your develop
 ment experience smoother and more efficient.\n

SUMMARY:Building a macOS screen saver with Kotlin [Lightning talk\, Interme

DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Márton Braun - Developer Advocate at JetBrains\n
 \nTwo years ago\, sitting in the audience at KotlinConf\, I was mesmerised 
 by the idle animation on the big screen. It was in the style of old school 
 DVD player screen savers\, with Kotlin's various logos through the years b
 ouncing from edge to edge.\n\nI later found out that this was a pre-render
 ed video\, and not a screen saver that I could just grab and start using. 
 This meant that I had no choice but to build it myself\, as a native macOS 
 application running on Kotlin/Native.\n\nJoin me for a tale of Kotlin succ
 ess and macOS failures\, as we explore just what it takes to build a scree
 n saver in Kotlin.\n\nWe'll see how easy it is to call native platform API
 s from Kotlin code\, what challenges the development of such an unusual ap
 plication presents\, and how macOS is very much not our friend on this who
 le journey.\n

 nHow do I create libraries for Kotlin Multiplatform projects? Kotlin lets 
 you share common code between different target platforms\, but by default 
 only a limit set of platform-agnostic APIs are available to the code. Grow
 ing the amount of APIs available required Kotlin Multiplatform libraries.\
 n\nI’ll talk through what it looks like to create such a library\, drawing 
 from my experience building and maintaining one of my own since the early 
 days of Kotlin/Native. We'll talk about how to find shared abstractions ar
 ound different platform APIs\, how to handle the fast-paced evolution of t
 his environment\, and what this all felt like as a first-time library deve
 loper. When we're done\, you’ll be ready to leverage the growing ecosystem 
 as well as make your own contributions.\n

SUMMARY:That's Unpossible – A full stack side project webapp (including a h

DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Dan Kim - Software Engineer\, Lover of Dogs\, Do
 nut & Pizza Enthusiast\n\nIt's happened to all of us – an idea strikes for 
 a side project and you want to build a quick webapp\, but then you remembe
 r the state of webdev is still a bit of a mess in 2025. Sure you could pic
 k up one of those "all-in-one" frameworks\, but they're so heavy and compl
 icated. And even if that worked\, you'd still need something on the fronte
 nd so you start looking at the the weird world of frontend frameworks or (
 gasp!) writing raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that 
 hard! I'm here to present a straightforward stack that gets you a full sta
 ck webapp up and running fast\, using the one language we all know and lov
 e – Kotlin. Database manipulation\, async services\, and a high fidelity U
 I\, all accessed and built with Kotlin. And yes\, you read that right – yo
 u can have a great UI without having to write a single line of CSS\, HTML\
 , or JavaScript.\n\nI'll show you a path for building a basic webapp on to
 p of a simple database (Postgres)\, performing basic CRUD operations on th
 at database (Kotlin Exposed)\, building business logic via async services 
 (Kotlin Coroutines)\, and constructing a high-fidelity UI to bring it all 
 together (Vaadin on Kotlin). By the end of the talk we'll have a fully fun
 ctional webapp that is entirely built on Kotlin.\n\nAnd let's not forget\, 
 we're not building a by-the-book\, very serious webapp\, just something we
 're doing on the side for fun. So forget about tests and forget about perf
 ect architecture – let's have some fun\, learn a few things along the way\
 , and get this thing running!\n

 create classic games\, this presentation covers my five-year journey to bu
 ild a NES emulator in Kotlin. Starting from scratch in 2020 (you can proba
 bly guess why)\, I’ll share the challenges posed by the architecture of ol
 d hardware\, performance optimization (surprise\, surprise)\, and the diff
 iculties of emulating sound. I’ll also highlight which Kotlin features shi
 ne (and why concurrency isn’t one of them). This high-level overview will 
 walk through each step of the process—from reading ROM formats to where GP
 T can help\, though it won’t write the code for us just yet. We’ll wrap up 
 by launching Mario on the emulator (hopefully without a call from Nintendo
 ).\n

SUMMARY:Making native SDKs Multiplatform at RevenueCat [Regular session\, I
 ntermediate\, Multiplatform]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Joop Korteweg - Senior Software Engineer @ Reven
 ueCat\n\nIn the rapidly evolving Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem a critical 
 gap has been the lack of a unified in-app purchase and subscription soluti
 on. Until now\, that is. The RevenueCat SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform allow
 s you to write your subscription code once and run it on both Android and 
 iOS. But how did we build it? We have existing native SDKs for both Androi
 d and iOS\, and did not want to rewrite all core logic. This talk will cov
 er the strategies\, pitfalls and learnings of our approach to bringing nat
 ive SDKs to Kotlin Multiplatform.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Writing Your Third Kotlin Compiler Plugin [Regular session\, Advanc
 ed\, Extensibility/Tooling]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Brian Norman - Kotlin Compiler @ JetBrains\n\nCo
 mpiler plugins have become an integral part of a developer’s experience wi
 th the Kotlin programming language. Areas like UI development (Jetpack Com
 pose)\, backend development (Spring Boot / Kotlin Serialization)\, and eve
 n testing (Power-Assert) all leverage compiler plugins. But what is a Kotl
 in compiler plugin and what can it do? Let’s learn by writing one!\n\nIn t
 his talk\, we’ll discuss use cases for compiler plugins and learn how they 
 integrate with the Kotlin compiler. Then we’ll explore everything related 
 to how code is represented within the Kotlin compiler\, including how to i
 nspect\, navigate\, transform\, and create these representations. When we’
 re done\, we’ll have written a compiler plugin from scratch which can navi
 gate the project code\, inspect annotations\, generate boilerplate\, and e
 ven report errors!\n

SUMMARY:Qualities of a Well-Functioning System [Regular session\, Introduct

DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Diana Montalion - Mentrix: Architecting Systems\
 n\n“We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system 
 tells us\, and discover how its properties and our values can work togethe
 r to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our 
 will alone.” -- Donella Meadows\n\nRelational complexity in software is co
 nstantly increasing. Data pipelines become a mesh. A monoliths becomes mic
 roservices. Synchronous database transactions become event-driven architec
 tures. Infrastructure becomes DevOps. Software is becoming systems of soft
 ware.\n\nAs technology professionals\, we are trapped between the desire f
 or control and the reality of systems. Increasingly\, we act amidst ambigu
 ity and uncertainty. We diversify and expand our skillset.  Systems challe
 nge our thinking patterns and core mental models. \n\nFortunately\, there 
 are some core principles for designing healthy systems. I don't mean (stri
 ctly) scalability or microservices. Three qualities are inherent in well-f
 unctioning systems: resilience\, self-organization and hierarchy. \n\nEach 
 of the qualities\, guaranteed\, differ from your current definition. In th
 is keynote\, we will explore them from a systems point of view.\n

SUMMARY:Collect Like a Pro: a deep dive on the Android lifecycle-aware coro
 utines APIs [Regular session\, Intermediate\, Android]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Manuel Vivo - Staff Android Engineer\n\nCollecti
 ng in a lifecycle-aware manner is essential for saving system resources. S
 ince coroutines and flows are the recommended solution for asynchronous pr
 ogramming on Android\, there are APIs that do most of the heavy-lifting wo
 rk for you. Namely: repeatOnLifecycle\, flowWithLifecycle\, and Compose’s 
 collectAsStateWithLifecycle. When building for Android\, you should includ
 e these libraries in your toolbox. But even if you’re doing KMP\, you shou
 ld keep this in mind.\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll see the different lifecycle-
 aware coroutines APIs\, the problems they solve\, and which types of flows 
 can make your system waste resources—Disclaimer! A cold flow backed by a C
 hannel or Flow operators with buffers might be under investigation. Prepar
 e to roll up your sleeves as we dissect their implementation details and l
 earn low-level coroutines and Compose APIs. But the journey doesn't end th
 ere! To help you think as a library developer\, we’ll explore an API regre
 t that never made it into stable to protect developers from misusing the A
 PI and force them respect coroutines’ structure concurrency.\n\nBy the end 
 of the talk\, you'll understand the importance of collecting in a lifecycl
 e-aware manner\, use low-level coroutines APIs to build your own APIs\, an
 d design APIs that respect structure concurrency and protect your users fr
 om misuse.\n

SUMMARY:Kotlin Multiplatform's Cross-Platform Brilliance at Norway's 377-Ye

 \, Server-side\, Multiplatform\, Language and best practices\, Other]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Anshika Koul - Senior Software Developer\, Poste
 n & Bring AS\n\nDo you have a complex business rule-set problem? You know 
 the kind where you have business rules (logic) spread across multiple plat
 forms\, systems and applications? Some of them might even be alter egos of 
 the same rule hiding in different apps. You never know which one might tur
 n up where\, there is no single source of truth\, solving errors takes hou
 rs of debugging\, and making changes requires (oftentimes) painful coordin
 ation across teams and applications (ugh).\n\nWe faced this exact challeng
 e at Posten Bring As - Norwegian National Postal Service founded way back 
 in 1647 - a 377-year-old institution with software spanning more generatio
 ns than most families! Our business logic was scattered across multiple pl
 atforms\, some almost as old as the company itself (well\, not quite\, but 
 it sure felt like it).\n\nIn my session I’m spilling the tea. We discover 
 how the team at century-old Norwegian postal services giant tackled modern 
 challenges with cutting-edge technology.\n\nWe’ll look through real-world 
 use cases at Posten Bring. We’ll reflect on what we did - key learnings\, 
 what went well and most importantly - what didn’t quite go as planned. We’
 ll also look through some resources to get started. We'll learn how KMP pr
 ovides a unified framework for code sharing and execution across various p
 latforms to solve the challenge of different codebases targeting different 
 runtimes.\n\nThis talk is for you if troublesome and unruly business logic 
 keeps you up at night and you want that to end NOW. It is also for you if 
 you like to hear a good story.\n

SUMMARY:Designing Kotlin Beyond Type-Inference [Regular session\, Advanced\
 , Language and best practices]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Ross Tate - Programming-Languages Researcher and 
 Consultant\n\nKotlin programmers regularly elide uninformative types from 
 their programs. This makes Kotlin programs faster to develop\, easier to r
 ead\, and less effort to maintain. It also means the Kotlin language needs 
 to be designed so that its compilers can reliably accept programs without 
 these typing hints. We think of this as type-inference\, but—by definition
 —type-inference means determining these missing types can be filled in suc
 h that the program type-checks.\n\nBut what if we can determine a program 
 is safe without determining these missing types? What if we can do so even 
 when it such types do not exist? And what if we can do so more efficiently 
 than any type-inference algorithm can?\nIn researching Kotlin's next-gener
 ation typing algorithms\, we have discovered we can efficiently exceed the 
 capabilities of type-inference and type-checking. We have developed a type
 -"outference" algorithm that efficiently decides "type-consistency"\, whic
 h all type-inferable/checkable programs satisfy (but not vice versa).\n\nW
 hile type-inference still has its place in user feedback and compilation\, 
 type-consistency is a much more flexible property\, and type-outference of
 fers clear guidelines on how to design features for efficient validation. 
 In this talk\, after introducing these concepts\, we will provide a behind
 -the-scenes look into how they guide the design of various expected and hy
 pothetical features for Kotlin\, such as union types for errors\, conditio
 nal inheritance for type-safe equality with value types\, and implicit pol
 ymorphism for non-escaping references.\n

 y of us use Android Studio and IntelliJ every day\, and appreciate how its 
 rich feature set makes our job easier. Most people know that both products 
 are built on the IntelliJ Platform\, the same that underpins the popular I
 DEs from JetBrains\, which has seen lasting success for over 20 years. It’
 s a solid\, expansive\, and by far the best foundation on which we could s
 tand on to deliver developer goodies.\n\nHowever\, some parts of the Intel
 liJ Platform show the signs of time\; in particular its UI framework\, Swi
 ng\, is proving the most limiting\, having been around for almost 30 years

 most non-unit function calls are no exception here. 'Check return value' o
 r 'ignored call result' may sound familiar — those are popular Java linter
 s' rules. However\, in our view\, this inspection is so crucial that it de
 serves its place among compiler diagnostics. In this talk\, we'll explore 
 the challenges and complexities down the road of making a brand-new langua

SUMMARY:Event-Driven Analytics: Building Real-Time Dashboards with Apache F
 link and Ktor [Regular session\, Intermediate\, Server-side\, Other]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Viktor Gamov - Principal Developer Advocate\, Co
 nfluent\n\nThe ability to process continuous data streams and deliver real
 -time insights has become crucial in modern application architectures. As 
 a developer you are probably very comfortable with RESTful services\, and 
 shifting to event-driven thinking opens new possibilities for responsivene
 ss and scalability (as well as new challenges and growing paints).\n\nThis 
 talk will explore building real-time analytics dashboards by combining Apa
 che Flink's powerful stream processing capabilities with Ktor's flexible w
 eb framework. We'll journey through the mental model transformation from r
 equest/response patterns to continuous event flows\, demonstrating how thi
 s shift enables truly reactive applications.\n\nYou'll learn:\n* How Apach
 e Flink handles stateful stream processing\, offering advantages for compl
 ex analytics use cases\n* Leveraging Flink's Table API and SQL capabilitie
 s to express complex transformations with familiar syntax\n* Implementing 
 real-time dashboards with Ktor and other Kotlin libraries\n\nBy the end of 
 this session\, you'll understand how to bridge the gap between powerful ba
 ckend stream processing and engaging user interfaces\, all while staying i
 n the Kotlin ecosystem. Regardless\, if you're a seasoned data streaming e
 ngineer or just beginning to explore beyond REST\, you'll bring home pract
 ical techniques for delivering real-time insights to your users.\n\n

SUMMARY:JSpecify: Java Nullness Annotations and Kotlin [Lightning talk\, In
 termediate\, Extensibility/Tooling\, Other]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    David Baker - Tech Lead of the Java and Kotlin E
 cosystem (JAKE) team at Google\n\nQ: Why should I care about Java nullness 
 annotations?\n\nA: Because they’ll make Kotlin code that uses Java librari
 es safer\, and because they’ll make it easier to convert Java code to Kotl
 in.\n\nJSpecify released a set of nullness annotations for Java in July. U
 nlike all the other nullness annotations for Java\, JSpecify’s are defined 
 by tool-agnostic specification. That means that all the Java nullness anal
 yzers will agree on what they mean\, and the Kotlin compiler will too. And 
 that means that your Kotlin code will be able to use null-safe types inste
 ad of platform types when it depends on well-annotated Java libraries.\n\n
 In this talk\, we’ll explain how Java nullness annotations will help you\, 
 and how JSpecify’s work. We’ll also tease upcoming projects that aren’t ab
 out nullness but might help your Kotlin code too.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Data Analysis for finance in Kotlin [Regular session\, Intermediate
 \, Other]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Enrique Lopez Manas - Google Developer Expert\n\
 nData representation and analysis in finance has a large literature alread
 y present in R and Python\, two of the most common suspects. They have the 
 community\, tooling and a long tradition. But what about Kotlin with some 
 of the libraries in the family\, like DataFrame and Kandy? Kotlin\, tradit
 ionally known for its focus in mobile and backend development\, has emerge
 d as a strong contender in the data science space. This session explores t
 he potential of Kotlin for financial data analysis\, focusing on the use o
 f the DataFrame library and the Kandy visualization framework.\n\nWe will 
 demonstrate how Kotlin provides a rich\, statically typed language environ
 ment\, ensuring safety\, conciseness\, and performance in handling large d
 atasets commonly encountered in financial contexts. DataFrame provides the 
 capacity to manipulate structured data\, while Kandy enables high-quality 
 visualizations.\n\nThis presentation will also provide a comparative analy
 sis between Kotlin\, R\, and Python. We will examine common use cases such 
 as dividend history\, stock valuation based on price and yields. While R a
 nd Python have established ecosystems for data science\, Kotlin's performa
 nce\, tooling\, and modern features offer new possibilities for finance pr
 ofessionals looking for a more efficient alternative.\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Simplifying Full-Stack Kotlin: A Fresh Take with HTMX and Ktor [Reg
 ular session\, Intermediate\, Server-side\, Other]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Anders Sveen - Continuous Delivery\, Simpler Tec
 hnology\n\nBeing a full-stack developer is valuable in today's tech landsc
 ape - you can own features end-to-end\, make holistic architectural decisi
 ons\, and adapt quickly to changing project needs. This versatility is esp
 ecially crucial in smaller teams and startups.\n\nHowever\, the role can b
 e intimidating. The list of technologies one is expected to master is exte
 nsive: Kubernetes\, Postgres\, Kotlin\, Gradle\, Ktor\, React\, Remix\, No
 de.js\, and NPM. Even the most experienced developers struggle to keep up 
 with it all.\n\nPerhaps we should step back and examine this problem from 
 a fresh perspective. Do we truly need all these technologies? After all\, 
 HTML and CSS remain relatively stable\, unlike frameworks that seem to cha
 nge every six months.\n\nMany applications don't require the complexity of 
 a modern Javascript Single Page Application (SPA). Everything eventually r
 enders to HTML anyway! Using technologies like HTML\, CSS\, HTMX\, AlpineJ
 S\, and Unpoly\, you can achieve 98% of SPA functionality with minimal fro
 ntend code and less complexity. These tools enhance and build upon HTML an
 d CSS rather than trying to replace them.\n\nIn this presentation\, I'll s
 how how HTMX and kotlinx.html combine beautifully with Ktor to create mode
 rn\, interactive web applications. You'll see how these technologies work 
 together seamlessly - Ktor's powerful backend capabilities\, kotlinx.html'
 s type-safe HTML generation\, and HTMX's elegant approach to frontend inte
 ractions. This stack offers a refreshingly simple way to build dynamic web 
 applications while keeping your codebase clean and maintainable.\n

DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Sargun Vohra - Software Engineer @ Headway\n\nWo
 rking with maps in a Kotlin Multiplatform app can be tricky—different plat
 form APIs\, inconsistent features\, and duplicated code add unwelcome comp
 lexity. MapLibre Compose simplifies this process by providing a consistent
 \, declarative API built on top of MapLibre and Compose Multiplatform.\n\n
 We’ll use practical examples to explore the design and implementation of M
 apLibre Compose\, how it leverages the Compose runtime to declaratively ex
 press the powerful mapping capabilities of MapLibre\, and how it uses Kotl
 in Multiplatform to help developers write map-based UI code once and run i
 t seamlessly on Android\, iOS\, and beyond without code duplication.\n\nFo
 r developers working with Compose Multiplatform\, this talk will showcase 
 how MapLibre Compose can help add mapping features to your apps. You'll ga
 in a clear understanding of its capabilities\, its design principles\, and 
 how it can help you create richer user experiences across platforms.\n

DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Elena van Engelen - Independent Senior Software 
 Engineer\n\nAs cloud platforms continue to evolve\, serverless functions p
 rovide powerful ways to build and scale applications with reduced infrastr
 ucture concerns. However\, cloud-specific requirements often make it chall
 enging to keep business logic portable across different cloud providers. T
 his session presents a variant of clean architecture designed to separate 
 core business logic from cloud-specific code\, leveraging Kotlin’s capabil
 ities along with Spring Cloud Function and headless Gradle modules.\n\nIn 
 this talk\, I’ll demonstrate how to structure a Kotlin application for ser
 verless using a simplified clean architecture approach. This structure mai
 ntains cloud-agnostic business logic while allowing platform-specific impl
 ementations for integration functionality like storage. By isolating busin
 ess logic in headless modules\, developers can deploy the same core code a
 cross multiple cloud function providers such as AWS Lambda and Azure Funct
 ions.\n\nThrough live coding\, we’ll explore practical techniques for buil
 ding and deploying serverless applications with cloud-agnostic business lo
 gic. \nThis session is aimed at advanced Kotlin developers interested in s
 erverless architecture\, cloud flexibility\, and clean architecture princi
 ples. \n

 olarWinds—experts who oversee billions of observability records daily—as t
 hey share their insights.\n\nWe'll kick off by covering what stream proces
 sing is and when you should use it. Dive into practical Kotlin solutions t
 hrough a simple case study on stripping PII from incoming user records usi
 ng Kafka Streams. We’ll build upon this example by utilizing Kafka's compa
 cting topics feature to distribute the user data and store it locally for 
 rapid API responses. Finally\, we’ll 'scale up' by moving that data out of 
 memory and into RocksDB\, demonstrating how to handle larger datasets effe
 ctively. By the end of this talk\, you'll be equipped to build your first 
 KStream or scale up the ones you’re already building.\n

SUMMARY:Scale your Kotlin Multiplatform projects using dependency injection 
 [Regular session\, Intermediate\, Multiplatform\, Language and best practi
 ces]
DESCRIPTION:Speakers:\n    Ralf Wondratschek - Principal Engineer at Amazon
 \n\nKotlin-inject-anvil is a dependency injection framework for Kotlin Mul
 tiplatform. It verifies the dependency graph at compile time and generates 
 the necessary code to instantiate the object graph at runtime. The framewo
 rk aims to provide a safe dependency injection solution without the boiler
 plate and configurations common in many other libraries.\n\nThis talk will 
 introduce kotlin-inject-anvil\, discussing its benefits and how it scales 
 in large\, modularized codebases. We'll explore how to leverage the streng
 ths of each host platform while maximizing common Kotlin Multiplatform cod
 e. Since each codebase is unique\, I'll demonstrate how we adapt the frame
 work for our own internal use cases at Amazon.\n
