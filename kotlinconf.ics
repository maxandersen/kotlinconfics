SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 1.
DESCRIPTION:If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low 
 latency\, high-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way arou
 nd virtual threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, bo
 th won’t get you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operatio
 ns\, and WebFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-
 blocking\, parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headach
 es due to its complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn th
 is workshop\, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe o
 ut all the downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of v
 irtual threads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking 
 reactive characteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, 
 we will explore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and 
 flows\, and apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in S
 pring Boot from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top 
 of WebFlux and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API call
 s using WebClient or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, 
 either via the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply struc
 tured concurrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in paralle
 l.\n- Create an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that comb
 ines coroutines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads 
 in-depth and see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\
 n\nAt the end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of progra
 mming in Spring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendo
 us benefits they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the kn
 owledge you gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with corouti
 nes the very next day.

SUMMARY:Extracting\, Transforming\, and Analyzing Data With Kotlin. Part 1.
DESCRIPTION:This workshop is designed for all Kotlin developers who need si
 mple and convenient tools within their native ecosystem to assist them whe
 n working with data\, understanding its nature\, performing any necessary 
 processing\, and presenting the results to their team or stakeholders as a 
 report or chart.\n\nIn this workshop\, you’ll learn how to build data proc
 essing pipelines in your applications. We’ll explore the best practices fo
 r extracting data from various sources\, aggregating and transforming it\, 
 and then exporting it as a collection of data classes\, displaying it as t
 ables\, or visualizing it with insightful charts.\n\nBy the end of the wor
 kshop\, you’ll be able to:\n\n- Load\, transform\, and export data using t
 he Kotlin DataFrame library.\n- Visualize data with the Kandy library to e
 ffectively convey insights.\n- Access and manipulate data from various sou
 rces: REST APIs\, SQL databases\, CSV files\, and other tabular data.\n- H
 andle both flat and hierarchical JSON-like data structures.\n- Boost your 
 code written with the help of the kotlin.collections or SQL-like framework
 s.\n- Solve practical problems by applying your skills to three real-world 
 scenarios.\n- Present the insights in Kotlin notebooks and easily share th
 em on GitHub Gists.

SUMMARY:Hands-On Kotlin Web Development With Ktor. Part 1.
DESCRIPTION:Ktor is a lightweight and flexible toolkit for building HTTP ap
 plications. This workshop will use the Kotlin programming language\, the K
 tor framework\, the Exposed database access library\, OpenAI\, and several 
 other Kotlin and Java libraries to build a feature-complete AI powered web 
 application.\n\nWe’ll start with the basics by exploring the Ktor framewor
 k and learning how to build a simple web application using essential funct
 ions. We’ll cover topics like handling HTTP requests\, working with WebSoc
 kets\, database access\, authentication\, logging\, and deployment.\n\nFor 
 testing\, we will look into the APIs that Ktor provides. Finally\, we will 
 explore the API for writing plugins and use it to create a simple plugin f
 or our Ktor application.\n\nBy the end of the workshop\, you’ll be able to
 :\n  - Structure Ktor projects\n  - Test Ktor applications\n  - Create and 
 deploy RESTful services using Ktor\n  - Integrate Ktor with external libra
 ries\n\nThis will be a fast-paced workshop where attendees will spend most 
 of their time coding. You will walk away armed with a cookbook of various 
 Ktor recipes for building feature-complete AI powered web application.

SUMMARY:Asynchronous Programming With Kotlin Coroutines. Part 1.
DESCRIPTION:In this workshop\, you’ll learn everything you need to know abo
 ut how to be productive with coroutines in Kotlin. We’ll start with the ba
 sics of asynchronous programming\, its differences from blocking code\, an
 d the concepts of suspending functions and coroutines. We’ll explore corou
 tine contexts\, concurrent decomposition of work via deferreds\, and struc
 tured concurrency with coroutine scopes.\n\nThe second part of the worksho
 p will be devoted to Kotlin Flows. We’ll study how Kotlin Flows are design
 ed on a basic level\, learn the difference between hot and cold flows\, di
 scuss their typical usage patterns\, and explore how they incorporate idea
 s from reactive streams. To deepen our understanding\, we’ll also take a p
 eek at some of the implementations behind flows and collectors. Throughout
 \, we’ll see how they help you in writing safe and reliable concurrent sys
 tems\, and how modern applications can use them to work with asynchronous 
 streams of data\, manage system states\, and broadcast events.\n\nThrough 
 this workshop\, you’ll enhance your coroutines-related vocabulary\, unders
 tand how to spot and avoid common problems\, and be able to effectively an
 d confidently use coroutines and flows in your own projects.

SUMMARY:Asynchronous Programming With Kotlin Coroutines. Part 3.
DESCRIPTION:In this workshop\, you’ll learn everything you need to know abo
 ut how to be productive with coroutines in Kotlin. We’ll start with the ba
 sics of asynchronous programming\, its differences from blocking code\, an
 d the concepts of suspending functions and coroutines. We’ll explore corou
 tine contexts\, concurrent decomposition of work via deferreds\, and struc
 tured concurrency with coroutine scopes.\n\nThe second part of the worksho
 p will be devoted to Kotlin Flows. We’ll study how Kotlin Flows are design
 ed on a basic level\, learn the difference between hot and cold flows\, di
 scuss their typical usage patterns\, and explore how they incorporate idea
 s from reactive streams. To deepen our understanding\, we’ll also take a p
 eek at some of the implementations behind flows and collectors. Throughout
 \, we’ll see how they help you in writing safe and reliable concurrent sys
 tems\, and how modern applications can use them to work with asynchronous 
 streams of data\, manage system states\, and broadcast events.\n\nThrough 
 this workshop\, you’ll enhance your coroutines-related vocabulary\, unders
 tand how to spot and avoid common problems\, and be able to effectively an
 d confidently use coroutines and flows in your own projects.

SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 4.
DESCRIPTION:If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low 
 latency\, high-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way arou
 nd virtual threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, bo
 th won’t get you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operatio
 ns\, and WebFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-
 blocking\, parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headach
 es due to its complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn th
 is workshop\, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe o
 ut all the downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of v
 irtual threads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking 
 reactive characteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, 
 we will explore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and 
 flows\, and apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in S
 pring Boot from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top 
 of WebFlux and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API call
 s using WebClient or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, 
 either via the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply struc
 tured concurrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in paralle
 l.\n- Create an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that comb
 ines coroutines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads 
 in-depth and see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\
 n\nAt the end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of progra
 mming in Spring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendo
 us benefits they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the kn
 owledge you gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with corouti
 nes the very next day.

SUMMARY:Building an Agentic Platform with Kotlin: Powering one of Europe's 
 Largest LLM Bot
DESCRIPTION:How does one build a multi-tenant\, multi-channel enterprise ap
 plication for multiple European countries with a new and non-deterministic 
 technology such as LLMs?\n\nThis is the question my team and I asked ourse
 lves over a year and a half ago.\n\nJoin me in my talk to discover how we 
 helped build one of Europe's biggest LLM chatbots and how this led to Arc\
 , an open-sourced Kotlin-based AI framework that is now part of the Eclips
 e Foundation.\n\nWhat makes Arc interesting is how it combines Kotlin DSL 
 and scripting to enable developers to build LLM-powered agents fast and ef
 ficiently\, and most importantly\, ready for the enterprise.\n\nIn this se
 ssion\, we will go through the journey of how and why the framework was bo
 rn.\n\nWe'll take a look at some of the design decisions that were made an
 d some of the key features of the framework\, such as observability\, memo
 ry\, and tools\, highlighting how we tackle some of our biggest challenges
 .\n\nAt the end of this session\, you should have a good understanding of 
 the challenges in building an LLM application at this scale\, as well as s
 ome strategies for solving these problems.

SUMMARY:Setting up your Mac for Kotlin Multiplatform Development
DESCRIPTION:If you have not built with KMP yet\, you will probably have to 
 install some software (e.g.\, Xcode\, iOS Simulator\, Android Studio Meerk
 at | 2024.3.1 or later). We recommend that you come to KotlinConf with all 
 of your KMP software installed as these applications are large and may tak
 e hours to install. But for those who need some help in getting everything 
 set up\, please join us.

SUMMARY:A (deep) dive into (shallow) immutability: Valhalla and beyond
DESCRIPTION:Immutability is getting more and more attention in modern progr
 amming\, making code easier to reason about\, safer in concurrent environm
 ents\, and more maintainable. However\, adopting immutability isn’t withou
 t challenges\, as it does improve the developer experience\, but can often 
 come with runtime costs. In Kotlin\, immutability is already a key part of 
 the language design\, but there’s significant potential to push its bounda
 ries even further.\n\nThis talk begins by exploring the current state of i
 mmutability in Kotlin. We’ll highlight what features the language already 
 provides\, examine what’s missing\, and discuss the reasons behind these d
 esign decisions. From there\, we’ll take a closer look at Project Valhalla
 \, an upcoming JVM initiative that introduces value types and other innova
 tions\, enabling new possibilities for Kotlin. We’ll discuss how Valhalla 
 can help enhance Kotlin’s immutability story and improve the programming e
 xperience without significant trade-offs.\n\nFinally\, we’ll explore the b
 roader immutability design space for Kotlin\, looking beyond Valhalla to i
 magine what future extensions could look like. We’ll discuss how new immut
 ability features could integrate with existing ones\, such as smart casts 
 and coroutines\, while maintaining the language’s pragmatic and developer-
 friendly nature.\n\nJoin this session to discover how Kotlin can evolve it
 s immutability story to better meet the needs of modern developers\, combi
 ning practicality with innovation.

SUMMARY:Extending Ktor for Server Side Development
DESCRIPTION:While Kotlin is seeing widespread adoption for Server side deve
 lopment\, Ktor\, Kotlin's minimalistic and flexible framework for server a
 nd client side development\, is sometimes overlooked\, largely because Spr
 ing Boot still offers an exhaustive range of starters. \n\nTo bridge this 
 gap\, kotlin developers can utilise Ktor's fluent Plugin API to provide al
 l the functionality they need for their own use cases\, and those of the w
 ider community.\n\nIn this session\, we will discuss developing plugins fo
 r Ktor and demonstrate a few interesting plugins that complement the stand
 ard set of Ktor’s features.\n\nYou’ll learn how to seamlessly integrate es
 sential functionalities like Kafka for message-driven architectures\, impl
 ement advanced rate limiting for traffic control\, and enhance system resi
 lience with a sophisticated Circuit Breaker plugin. Each plugin is crafted 
 to offer flexibility and ease of integration\, making your development exp

 old school DVD player screen savers\, with Kotlin's various logos through 
 the years bouncing from edge to edge.\n\nI later found out that this was a 
 pre-rendered video\, and not a screen saver that I could just grab and sta
 rt using. This meant that I had no choice but to build it myself\, as a na
 tive macOS application running on Kotlin/Native.\n\nJoin me for a tale of 
 Kotlin success and macOS failures\, as we explore just what it takes to bu
 ild a screen saver in Kotlin.\n\nWe'll see how easy it is to call native p
 latform APIs from Kotlin code\, what challenges the development of such an 
 unusual application presents\, and how macOS is very much not our friend o
 n this whole journey.

SUMMARY:Introducing Compose Hot Reload
DESCRIPTION:Compose Hot Reload is a new plugin for Compose apps running on 
 the JVM\, which lets you see the results of your code changes live\, witho
 ut having to restart the app.\n\nIn this talk\, we'll look at where Compos
 e Hot Reload is today and how you can use it in your projects to make iter
 ating on UI code faster\, more convenient\, and more exciting!\n\nThen we'
 ll dive into the technical details to see how multiple JetBrains technolog
 ies came together\, step by step\, lifting a modern UI framework to the ne
 xt level. We'll also learn about all the fun issues encountered and decisi
 ons that had to be made along the way.

SUMMARY:Coroutine Debugging in IntelliJ IDEA
DESCRIPTION:During the past 1.5 years\, we’ve implemented the smooth corout
 ine debugging experience\, so it would feel almost the same as debugging s
 ynchronous code and even better! In this talk I will show you the capabili
 ties of coroutine debugger and best practices for debugging coroutines. Al
 so\, I’ll tell you a little bit about the challenges we faced while implem
 enting these improvements\, such as deep integration and communication bet
 ween the IDE and the coroutine library.

SUMMARY:Full Stream Ahead: Breaking the protocol barrier with http4k
DESCRIPTION:HTTP's request-response pattern has served us well\, but modern 
 web applications demand more. Real-time communication demands different pr
 otocols\, yet maintaining testability and simplicity remains crucial to de
 veloper experience.\n\nIn this talk\, we'll explore how http4k extends HTT
 P's capabilities through WebSocket and Server-Sent Events support and how 
 these protocols can be modelled as simple functions\, making them as testa
 ble as plain HTTP endpoints. We'll then show how these streaming capabilit
 ies open up new possibilities for server-side rendering\, bringing us full 
 circle from the days of JSP to modern reactive interfaces - all while keep
 ing the complexity on the server where it belongs.\n\nJoin us to discover 
 how http4k's streaming capabilities can enhance your web applications\, en
 abling everything from chat applications to live dashboards and reactive s
 erver-rendered interfaces.

DESCRIPTION:How do I create libraries for Kotlin Multiplatform projects? Ko
 tlin lets you share common code between different target platforms\, but b
 y default only a limit set of platform-agnostic APIs are available to the 
 code. Growing the amount of APIs available required Kotlin Multiplatform l
 ibraries.\n\nI’ll talk through what it looks like to create such a library
 \, drawing from my experience building and maintaining one of my own since 
 the early days of Kotlin/Native. We'll talk about how to find shared abstr
 actions around different platform APIs\, how to handle the fast-paced evol
 ution of this environment\, and what this all felt like as a first-time li
 brary developer. When we're done\, you’ll be ready to leverage the growing 
 ecosystem as well as make your own contributions.

DESCRIPTION:Let's see how many compose drawing techniques we can demo in 45 
 minutes. This live code speed run will start simple and quickly escalate. 
 I will try out as many drawing techniques as will fit into the time and sc
 reen space in a compose desktop app. Thanks to hot reloading we will be ab
 le to see the effects as the code changes.\n\nAt the end of this talk the 
 audience will:\n\n- have a good overview of what is possible with compose 
 drawing\n- see hot reload in action\n- get access to the open source repo 
 of samples as a reference

SUMMARY:LangChain4j with Quarkus
DESCRIPTION:Kotlin is loved for its expressiveness\, Quarkus for its blazin
 g-fast runtime\, and LangChain4j for integrating AI into modern applicatio
 ns. But what happens when you bring all three together? You unlock the pot
 ential to build cutting-edge\, AI-powered applications efficiently.\n\nDes
 pite the growing demand for AI-driven solutions\, integrating AI workflows 
 into existing applications remains a challenge for many Kotlin developers. 
 Pain points include complex setup\, lack of synergy between frameworks\, a
 nd maintaining high performance while leveraging AI tools.\n\nThis talk of
 fers a solution: combining LangChain4j and Quarkus to create Kotlin applic
 ations that leverage AI capabilities seamlessly. We’ll explore how to stre
 amline integration\, manage dependencies\, and use Kotlin’s idiomatic feat
 ures to simplify AI workflows.\n\nWho is this talk for? Kotlin developers 
 curious about embedding AI into their apps\, and Quarkus fans eager to exp
 lore its potential in AI-driven use cases. Attendees will leave with actio
 nable insights\, including code samples\, to build AI-powered applications 
 confidently.

SUMMARY:That's Unpossible – A full stack side project webapp (including a h
 igh-fidelity UI!) all in Kotlin
DESCRIPTION:It's happened to all of us – an idea strikes for a side project 
 and you want to build a quick webapp\, but then you remember the state of 
 webdev is still a bit of a mess in 2025. Sure you could pick up one of tho
 se "all-in-one" frameworks\, but they're so heavy and complicated. And eve
 n if that worked\, you'd still need something on the frontend so you start 
 looking at the the weird world of frontend frameworks or (gasp!) writing r
 aw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that hard! I'm here t
 o present a straightforward stack that gets you a full stack webapp up and 
 running fast\, using the one language we all know and love – Kotlin. Datab
 ase manipulation\, async services\, and a high fidelity UI\, all accessed 
 and built with Kotlin. And yes\, you read that right – you can have a grea
 t UI without having to write a single line of CSS\, HTML\, or JavaScript.\
 n\nI'll show you a path for building a basic webapp on top of a simple dat
 abase (Postgres)\, performing basic CRUD operations on that database (Kotl
 in Exposed)\, building business logic via async services (Kotlin Coroutine
 s)\, and constructing a high-fidelity UI to bring it all together (Vaadin 
 on Kotlin). By the end of the talk we'll have a fully functional webapp th
 at is entirely built on Kotlin.\n\nAnd let's not forget\, we're not buildi
 ng a by-the-book\, very serious webapp\, just something we're doing on the 
 side for fun. So forget about tests and forget about perfect architecture 
 – let's have some fun\, learn a few things along the way\, and get this th
 ing running!

 s why)\, I’ll share the challenges posed by the architecture of old hardwa
 re\, performance optimization (surprise\, surprise)\, and the difficulties 
 of emulating sound. I’ll also highlight which Kotlin features shine (and w
 hy concurrency isn’t one of them). This high-level overview will walk thro
 ugh each step of the process—from reading ROM formats to where GPT can hel
 p\, though it won’t write the code for us just yet. We’ll wrap up by launc
 hing Mario on the emulator (hopefully without a call from Nintendo).

SUMMARY:Making native SDKs Multiplatform at RevenueCat
DESCRIPTION:In the rapidly evolving Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem a critic

 lows you to write your subscription code once and run it on both Android a
 nd iOS. But how did we build it? We have existing native SDKs for both And
 roid and iOS\, and did not want to rewrite all core logic. This talk will 
 cover the strategies\, pitfalls and learnings of our approach to bringing 
 native SDKs to Kotlin Multiplatform.\n\n

SUMMARY:Writing Your Third Kotlin Compiler Plugin
DESCRIPTION:Compiler plugins have become an integral part of a developer’s 
 experience with the Kotlin programming language. Areas like UI development 
 (Jetpack Compose)\, backend development (Spring Boot / Kotlin Serializatio
 n)\, and even testing (Power-Assert) all leverage compiler plugins. But wh
 at is a Kotlin compiler plugin and what can it do? Let’s learn by writing 
 one!\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll discuss use cases for compiler plugins and le
 arn how they integrate with the Kotlin compiler. Then we’ll explore everyt
 hing related to how code is represented within the Kotlin compiler\, inclu
 ding how to inspect\, navigate\, transform\, and create these representati
 ons. When we’re done\, we’ll have written a compiler plugin from scratch w
 hich can navigate the project code\, inspect annotations\, generate boiler
 plate\, and even report errors!

SUMMARY:Qualities of a Well-Functioning System
DESCRIPTION:“We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what th
 e system tells us\, and discover how its properties and our values can wor
 k together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produce
 d by our will alone.” -- Donella Meadows\n\nRelational complexity in softw
 are is constantly increasing. Data pipelines become a mesh. A monoliths be
 comes microservices. Synchronous database transactions become event-driven 
 architectures. Infrastructure becomes DevOps. Software is becoming systems 
 of software.\n\nAs technology professionals\, we are trapped between the d
 esire for control and the reality of systems. Increasingly\, we act amidst 
 ambiguity and uncertainty. We diversify and expand our skillset.  Systems 
 challenge our thinking patterns and core mental models. \n\nFortunately\, 
 there are some core principles for designing healthy systems. I don't mean 
 (strictly) scalability or microservices. Three qualities are inherent in w
 ell-functioning systems: resilience\, self-organization and hierarchy. \n\
 nEach of the qualities\, guaranteed\, differ from your current definition. 
 In this keynote\, we will explore them from a systems point of view.

 row our way and possible workarounds. We'll also compare dependency manage
 ment tools used on Apple platforms like CocoaPods and Swift Package Manage
 r to see their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nLearn how native dependencies

SUMMARY:Collect Like a Pro: a deep dive on the Android lifecycle-aware coro
 utines APIs
DESCRIPTION:Collecting in a lifecycle-aware manner is essential for saving 
 system resources. Since coroutines and flows are the recommended solution 
 for asynchronous programming on Android\, there are APIs that do most of t
 he heavy-lifting work for you. Namely: repeatOnLifecycle\, flowWithLifecyc
 le\, and Compose’s collectAsStateWithLifecycle. When building for Android\
 , you should include these libraries in your toolbox. But even if you’re d
 oing KMP\, you should keep this in mind.\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll see the d
 ifferent lifecycle-aware coroutines APIs\, the problems they solve\, and w
 hich types of flows can make your system waste resources—Disclaimer! A col
 d flow backed by a Channel or Flow operators with buffers might be under i
 nvestigation. Prepare to roll up your sleeves as we dissect their implemen
 tation details and learn low-level coroutines and Compose APIs. But the jo
 urney doesn't end there! To help you think as a library developer\, we’ll 
 explore an API regret that never made it into stable to protect developers 
 from misusing the API and force them respect coroutines’ structure concurr
 ency.\n\nBy the end of the talk\, you'll understand the importance of coll
 ecting in a lifecycle-aware manner\, use low-level coroutines APIs to buil
 d your own APIs\, and design APIs that respect structure concurrency and p
 rotect your users from misuse.

SUMMARY:Kotlin Multiplatform's Cross-Platform Brilliance at Norway's 377-Ye
 ar-Old National Postal Service
DESCRIPTION:Do you have a complex business rule-set problem? You know the k
 ind where you have business rules (logic) spread across multiple platforms
 \, systems and applications? Some of them might even be alter egos of the 
 same rule hiding in different apps. You never know which one might turn up 
 where\, there is no single source of truth\, solving errors takes hours of 
 debugging\, and making changes requires (oftentimes) painful coordination 
 across teams and applications (ugh).\n\nWe faced this exact challenge at P
 osten Bring As - Norwegian National Postal Service founded way back in 164
 7 - a 377-year-old institution with software spanning more generations tha
 n most families! Our business logic was scattered across multiple platform
 s\, some almost as old as the company itself (well\, not quite\, but it su
 re felt like it).\n\nIn my session I’m spilling the tea. We discover how t
 he team at century-old Norwegian postal services giant tackled modern chal
 lenges with cutting-edge technology.\n\nWe’ll look through real-world use

 went well and most importantly - what didn’t quite go as planned. We’ll al
 so look through some resources to get started. We'll learn how KMP provide

SUMMARY:Designing Kotlin Beyond Type-Inference
DESCRIPTION:Kotlin programmers regularly elide uninformative types from the
 ir programs. This makes Kotlin programs faster to develop\, easier to read
 \, and less effort to maintain. It also means the Kotlin language needs to 
 be designed so that its compilers can reliably accept programs without the
 se typing hints. We think of this as type-inference\, but—by definition—ty
 pe-inference means determining these missing types can be filled in such t
 hat the program type-checks.\n\nBut what if we can determine a program is 
 safe without determining these missing types? What if we can do so even wh
 en it such types do not exist? And what if we can do so more efficiently t
 han any type-inference algorithm can?\nIn researching Kotlin's next-genera
 tion typing algorithms\, we have discovered we can efficiently exceed the 
 capabilities of type-inference and type-checking. We have developed a type
 -"outference" algorithm that efficiently decides "type-consistency"\, whic
 h all type-inferable/checkable programs satisfy (but not vice versa).\n\nW
 hile type-inference still has its place in user feedback and compilation\, 
 type-consistency is a much more flexible property\, and type-outference of
 fers clear guidelines on how to design features for efficient validation. 
 In this talk\, after introducing these concepts\, we will provide a behind
 -the-scenes look into how they guide the design of various expected and hy
 pothetical features for Kotlin\, such as union types for errors\, conditio
 nal inheritance for type-safe equality with value types\, and implicit pol
 ymorphism for non-escaping references.

 n.\n\nSo what does a good scalable setup mean? Are the best practices univ
 ersal for all types of project? Are there Kotlin specific best practices? 
 When and how should you introduce them? Let’s dive in!

SUMMARY:Project Sparkles: How Compose for Desktop is changing Android Studi
 o and IntelliJ
DESCRIPTION:Many of us use Android Studio and IntelliJ every day\, and appr
 eciate how its rich feature set makes our job easier. Most people know tha
 t both products are built on the IntelliJ Platform\, the same that underpi
 ns the popular IDEs from JetBrains\, which has seen lasting success for ov
 er 20 years. It’s a solid\, expansive\, and by far the best foundation on 
 which we could stand on to deliver developer goodies.\n\nHowever\, some pa
 rts of the IntelliJ Platform show the signs of time\; in particular its UI 
 framework\, Swing\, is proving the most limiting\, having been around for 
 almost 30 years. Don’t get us wrong — it works\, and the IDEs themselves p
 rove you can ship complex UIs by using Swing on the IntelliJ Platform. But 
 as we looked at how nice it is to develop UIs on desktop by using Compose 
 for Desktop\, we thought: why don’t we do the same?\n\nEnter Project Spark
 les\, which aims at gradually introducing new high-quality\, polished UI s
 urfaces in Android Studio and IntelliJ\, developed in Compose for Desktop\
 , with all the bells and whistles you can expect from a top-tier interface
 . In this talk\, we’ll cover how Project Sparkles is impacting the develop
 ment of Android Studio and IntelliJ\, addressing long-standing user feedba
 ck\, and how Google and JetBrains are working together to build a framewor
 k to make your favorite IDE even better and easier to understand.\n\nWe’ll 
 demonstrate a few examples of features already shipping that are powered b
 y Project Sparkles\, explain what our goals and ambitions are\, and even s
 how some sneak peeks of things you may see in a future IDE version. We wil
 l also cover a roadmap on when developers can expect to use Compose for De
 sktop as a supported UI framework for IntelliJ plugin development!\n\nUI e

SUMMARY:Event-Driven Analytics: Building Real-Time Dashboards with Apache F
 link and Ktor
DESCRIPTION:The ability to process continuous data streams and deliver real
 -time insights has become crucial in modern application architectures. As 
 a developer you are probably very comfortable with RESTful services\, and 
 shifting to event-driven thinking opens new possibilities for responsivene
 ss and scalability (as well as new challenges and growing paints).\n\nThis 
 talk will explore building real-time analytics dashboards by combining Apa
 che Flink's powerful stream processing capabilities with Ktor's flexible w
 eb framework. We'll journey through the mental model transformation from r
 equest/response patterns to continuous event flows\, demonstrating how thi
 s shift enables truly reactive applications.\n\nYou'll learn:\n* How Apach
 e Flink handles stateful stream processing\, offering advantages for compl
 ex analytics use cases\n* Leveraging Flink's Table API and SQL capabilitie
 s to express complex transformations with familiar syntax\n* Implementing 
 real-time dashboards with Ktor and other Kotlin libraries\n\nBy the end of 
 this session\, you'll understand how to bridge the gap between powerful ba
 ckend stream processing and engaging user interfaces\, all while staying i
 n the Kotlin ecosystem. Regardless\, if you're a seasoned data streaming e
 ngineer or just beginning to explore beyond REST\, you'll bring home pract
 ical techniques for delivering real-time insights to your users.\n

SUMMARY:JSpecify: Java Nullness Annotations and Kotlin
DESCRIPTION:Q: Why should I care about Java nullness annotations?\n\nA: Bec
 ause they’ll make Kotlin code that uses Java libraries safer\, and because 
 they’ll make it easier to convert Java code to Kotlin.\n\nJSpecify release
 d a set of nullness annotations for Java in July. Unlike all the other nul
 lness annotations for Java\, JSpecify’s are defined by tool-agnostic speci
 fication. That means that all the Java nullness analyzers will agree on wh
 at they mean\, and the Kotlin compiler will too. And that means that your 
 Kotlin code will be able to use null-safe types instead of platform types 
 when it depends on well-annotated Java libraries.\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll 
 explain how Java nullness annotations will help you\, and how JSpecify’s w
 ork. We’ll also tease upcoming projects that aren’t about nullness but mig
 ht help your Kotlin code too.\n\n

SUMMARY:Data Analysis for finance in Kotlin
DESCRIPTION:Data representation and analysis in finance has a large literat
 ure already present in R and Python\, two of the most common suspects. The
 y have the community\, tooling and a long tradition. But what about Kotlin 
 with some of the libraries in the family\, like DataFrame and Kandy? Kotli
 n\, traditionally known for its focus in mobile and backend development\, 
 has emerged as a strong contender in the data science space. This session 
 explores the potential of Kotlin for financial data analysis\, focusing on 
 the use of the DataFrame library and the Kandy visualization framework.\n\
 nWe will demonstrate how Kotlin provides a rich\, statically typed languag
 e environment\, ensuring safety\, conciseness\, and performance in handlin
 g large datasets commonly encountered in financial contexts. DataFrame pro
 vides the capacity to manipulate structured data\, while Kandy enables hig
 h-quality visualizations.\n\nThis presentation will also provide a compara
 tive analysis between Kotlin\, R\, and Python. We will examine common use 
 cases such as dividend history\, stock valuation based on price and yields
 . While R and Python have established ecosystems for data science\, Kotlin
 's performance\, tooling\, and modern features offer new possibilities for 
 finance professionals looking for a more efficient alternative.\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Simplifying Full-Stack Kotlin: A Fresh Take with HTMX and Ktor
DESCRIPTION:Being a full-stack developer is valuable in today's tech landsc
 ape - you can own features end-to-end\, make holistic architectural decisi
 ons\, and adapt quickly to changing project needs. This versatility is esp
 ecially crucial in smaller teams and startups.\n\nHowever\, the role can b
 e intimidating. The list of technologies one is expected to master is exte
 nsive: Kubernetes\, Postgres\, Kotlin\, Gradle\, Ktor\, React\, Remix\, No
 de.js\, and NPM. Even the most experienced developers struggle to keep up 
 with it all.\n\nPerhaps we should step back and examine this problem from 
 a fresh perspective. Do we truly need all these technologies? After all\, 
 HTML and CSS remain relatively stable\, unlike frameworks that seem to cha
 nge every six months.\n\nMany applications don't require the complexity of 
 a modern Javascript Single Page Application (SPA). Everything eventually r
 enders to HTML anyway! Using technologies like HTML\, CSS\, HTMX\, AlpineJ
 S\, and Unpoly\, you can achieve 98% of SPA functionality with minimal fro
 ntend code and less complexity. These tools enhance and build upon HTML an
 d CSS rather than trying to replace them.\n\nIn this presentation\, I'll s
 how how HTMX and kotlinx.html combine beautifully with Ktor to create mode
 rn\, interactive web applications. You'll see how these technologies work 
 together seamlessly - Ktor's powerful backend capabilities\, kotlinx.html'
 s type-safe HTML generation\, and HTMX's elegant approach to frontend inte
 ractions. This stack offers a refreshingly simple way to build dynamic web 
 applications while keeping your codebase clean and maintainable.

SUMMARY:Bringing Maps to Compose Multiplatform with MapLibre Compose
DESCRIPTION:Working with maps in a Kotlin Multiplatform app can be tricky—d
 ifferent platform APIs\, inconsistent features\, and duplicated code add u
 nwelcome complexity. MapLibre Compose simplifies this process by providing 
 a consistent\, declarative API built on top of MapLibre and Compose Multip
 latform.\n\nWe’ll use practical examples to explore the design and impleme
 ntation of MapLibre Compose\, how it leverages the Compose runtime to decl
 aratively express the powerful mapping capabilities of MapLibre\, and how 
 it uses Kotlin Multiplatform to help developers write map-based UI code on
 ce and run it seamlessly on Android\, iOS\, and beyond without code duplic
 ation.\n\nFor developers working with Compose Multiplatform\, this talk wi
 ll showcase how MapLibre Compose can help add mapping features to your app
 s. You'll gain a clear understanding of its capabilities\, its design prin
 ciples\, and how it can help you create richer user experiences across pla
 tforms.

SUMMARY:Fast inner dev loops for Kotlin Gradle builds
DESCRIPTION:Whether it's a Kotlin library or an Android app\, developers wa
 nt their inner loop to be fast: code\, compile\, test\, repeat. With Gradl
 e\, there are no extra steps—you run the test\, and it takes care of the r
 est\, whether you’re tweaking a single line of code or upgrading all your 
 dependencies.\n\nIn this talk\, learn how to tame the inner dev loop. We'l
 l explore the recent evolution of Gradle's performance features\, such as 
 Configuration Cache and Isolated Projects\, and how to organize your Kotli
 n build to make the most of it.

SUMMARY:Lessons learned decoupling Architecture Components from platform sp
 ecific code
DESCRIPTION:Follow along as the Android team walks you through the process 
 of taking some of their architectural building blocks\, such as SavedState 
 and System Back\, through the process of decoupling them from platform spe
 cific implementations and how they approached the task of writing good com
 mon APIs in preparation for future integrations with other platforms while 
 maintaining the quality achieved in android.

SUMMARY:Kotlin Clean Architecture for Serverless: Business Logic You Can Ta
 ke Anywhere
DESCRIPTION:As cloud platforms continue to evolve\, serverless functions pr
 ovide powerful ways to build and scale applications with reduced infrastru
 cture concerns. However\, cloud-specific requirements often make it challe
 nging to keep business logic portable across different cloud providers. Th
 is session presents a variant of clean architecture designed to separate c
 ore business logic from cloud-specific code\, leveraging Kotlin’s capabili
 ties along with Spring Cloud Function and headless Gradle modules.\n\nIn t
 his talk\, I’ll demonstrate how to structure a Kotlin application for serv
 erless using a simplified clean architecture approach. This structure main
 tains cloud-agnostic business logic while allowing platform-specific imple
 mentations for integration functionality like storage. By isolating busine
 ss logic in headless modules\, developers can deploy the same core code ac
 ross multiple cloud function providers such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functi
 ons.\n\nThrough live coding\, we’ll explore practical techniques for build
 ing and deploying serverless applications with cloud-agnostic business log
 ic. \nThis session is aimed at advanced Kotlin developers interested in se
 rverless architecture\, cloud flexibility\, and clean architecture princip
 les.

SUMMARY:Swift concurrency for curious Kotliners
DESCRIPTION:Swift is an open-source programming language by Apple\, primari
 ly used for building apps within the Apple ecosystem.\n\nA new major versi
 on of Swift - Swift 6 was released at the end of the previous year. The st
 andout feature of the release is strict concurrency mode\, which aims to p
 revent data races.\n\nIn this talk\, we will take a quick look at Swift ac
 tors and `async`/`await` features\, which share a lot of similarities with 
 Kotlin Coroutines. We will explore what does Swift 6 do to prevent data ra
 ces\, and\, perhaps\, discuss if we can expect a similar feature in future 
 versions of Kotlin.\n\nThe talk assumes that the attendees are familiar wi
 th Kotlin Coroutines.

SUMMARY:Klibs.io — the dream of creating a Kotlin Package Index
DESCRIPTION:So you want to build a Kotlin package index.. What is a package 
 anyway\, is it the same as an artifact? What makes a project a library the
 n? And why is it an index and not a repository?\n\nThis talk is a story an
 d a retrospective of developing [https://klibs.io](https://klibs.io)\n\nI 
 will share the insights I learned after processing 250\,000 KMP artifacts 
 and 1\,500 Kotlin projects. We'll discuss our library sharing ecosystem an
 d its limitations\, and I will give tips to library authors on how to stan
 d out and make their libraries more discoverable

SUMMARY:47 Refactorings in 45 minutes
DESCRIPTION:IntelliJ IDEA's refactoring support is second to none\, but the 
 Refactor This menu only has 9 items. Where is all the power hiding?\n\nJoi
 n Dmitry and Duncan on a whistle-stop live-coding tour of our favourite ID
 E's invisible refactorings. Marvel as Alt-Enter reveals refactorings befor
 e your very eyes. Gasp as they change depending on context. Wonder how com
 pletely different they can be simply by moving the cursor one character to 
 the left or right\, and feel the tension mount as they approach the deadli
 ne. Can they really show more than one refactoring a minute?

SUMMARY:From Data to Insights: Building a Bluesky Bot powered by AI
DESCRIPTION:\nA common challenge developers face when working with data str
 eams is collecting and analyzing this data as fast as possible to uncover 
 meaningful insights or take fast actions.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll show you 
 how I tackled this by building a Bluesky bot that turns raw data collected 
 from the Bluesky’s stream of posts into actionable insights.\n\nIn this ta
 lk you will learn how to: \n- Collect data into streams\n- Use probabilist
 ic data structures such as Bloom Filters\, TopK and Count-Min Sketch\n- Us
 e Retrieval-Augmented Generation for adding your own knowledge base into y
 our LLM queries\n- Use semantic caching for reducing LLM calls\n- Use vect
 or siilarity search to classify the data\n- Efficiently querythe data\n\nW
 hether you’re curious about GenAI\, interested in data-driven analytics\, 
 or simply love experimenting with creative tech solutions\, this session w
 ill inspire you with practical techniques and real-world applications.

SUMMARY:Stream Processing Rocks! Stream processing in Kotlin from KStreams 
 to RocksDB
DESCRIPTION:Ever wondered how to efficiently process high-velocity data str
 eams using Kafka and Kotlin? Join two engineers from SolarWinds—experts wh
 o oversee billions of observability records daily—as they share their insi
 ghts.\n\nWe'll kick off by covering what stream processing is and when you 
 should use it. Dive into practical Kotlin solutions through a simple case 
 study on stripping PII from incoming user records using Kafka Streams. We’
 ll build upon this example by utilizing Kafka's compacting topics feature 
 to distribute the user data and store it locally for rapid API responses. 
 Finally\, we’ll 'scale up' by moving that data out of memory and into Rock
 sDB\, demonstrating how to handle larger datasets effectively. By the end 
 of this talk\, you'll be equipped to build your first KStream or scale up 
 the ones you’re already building.

SUMMARY:Scale your Kotlin Multiplatform projects using dependency injection
DESCRIPTION:Kotlin-inject-anvil is a dependency injection framework for Kot
 lin Multiplatform. It verifies the dependency graph at compile time and ge
 nerates the necessary code to instantiate the object graph at runtime. The 
 framework aims to provide a safe dependency injection solution without the 
 boilerplate and configurations common in many other libraries.\n\nThis tal
 k will introduce kotlin-inject-anvil\, discussing its benefits and how it 
 scales in large\, modularized codebases. We'll explore how to leverage the 
 strengths of each host platform while maximizing common Kotlin Multiplatfo
 rm code. Since each codebase is unique\, I'll demonstrate how we adapt the 
 framework for our own internal use cases at Amazon.
