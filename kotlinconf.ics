DESCRIPTION:\n                        Speakers:\n                            
 Urs Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains certified Kot

 If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, h
 igh-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way around virtual 
 threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t ge
 t you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operations\, and We
 bFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, 
 parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headaches due to i
 ts complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe out all the 
 downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of virtual thre
 ads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking reactive ch
 aracteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will exp
 lore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, an
 d apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in Spring Boot 
 from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux 
 and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API calls using Web
 Client or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, either via 
 the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply structured concu
 rrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in parallel.\n- Creat
 e an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that combines corout
 ines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads in-depth a
 nd see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the 
 end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of programming in S
 pring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendous benefit
 s they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge yo
 u gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with coroutines the ve
 ry next day.\n

 l learn everything you need to know about how to be productive with corout
 ines in Kotlin. We’ll start with the basics of asynchronous programming\, 
 its differences from blocking code\, and the concepts of suspending functi
 ons and coroutines. We’ll explore coroutine contexts\, concurrent decompos
 ition of work via deferreds\, and structured concurrency with coroutine sc
 opes.\n\nThe second part of the workshop will be devoted to Kotlin Flows. 
 We’ll study how Kotlin Flows are designed on a basic level\, learn the dif
 ference between hot and cold flows\, discuss their typical usage patterns\
 , and explore how they incorporate ideas from reactive streams. To deepen 
 our understanding\, we’ll also take a peek at some of the implementations 
 behind flows and collectors. Throughout\, we’ll see how they help you in w
 riting safe and reliable concurrent systems\, and how modern applications 
 can use them to work with asynchronous streams of data\, manage system sta
 tes\, and broadcast events.\n\nThrough this workshop\, you’ll enhance your 
 coroutines-related vocabulary\, understand how to spot and avoid common pr
 oblems\, and be able to effectively and confidently use coroutines and flo
 ws in your own projects.\n

 l learn everything you need to know about how to be productive with corout
 ines in Kotlin. We’ll start with the basics of asynchronous programming\, 
 its differences from blocking code\, and the concepts of suspending functi
 ons and coroutines. We’ll explore coroutine contexts\, concurrent decompos
 ition of work via deferreds\, and structured concurrency with coroutine sc
 opes.\n\nThe second part of the workshop will be devoted to Kotlin Flows. 
 We’ll study how Kotlin Flows are designed on a basic level\, learn the dif
 ference between hot and cold flows\, discuss their typical usage patterns\
 , and explore how they incorporate ideas from reactive streams. To deepen 
 our understanding\, we’ll also take a peek at some of the implementations 
 behind flows and collectors. Throughout\, we’ll see how they help you in w
 riting safe and reliable concurrent systems\, and how modern applications 
 can use them to work with asynchronous streams of data\, manage system sta
 tes\, and broadcast events.\n\nThrough this workshop\, you’ll enhance your 
 coroutines-related vocabulary\, understand how to spot and avoid common pr
 oblems\, and be able to effectively and confidently use coroutines and flo
 ws in your own projects.\n

SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 3. [Workshop\
 , Intermediate]
DESCRIPTION:\n                        Speakers:\n                            
 Urs Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains certified Kot
 lin Trainer \n\n                        <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/sc
 hedule/?session=f1e2f2f2-fbe4-583b-8b23-b4ad4584566b">link</a>\n\n                        
 If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, h
 igh-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way around virtual 
 threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t ge
 t you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operations\, and We
 bFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, 
 parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headaches due to i
 ts complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe out all the 
 downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of virtual thre
 ads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking reactive ch
 aracteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will exp
 lore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, an
 d apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in Spring Boot 
 from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux 
 and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API calls using Web
 Client or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, either via 
 the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply structured concu
 rrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in parallel.\n- Creat
 e an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that combines corout
 ines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads in-depth a
 nd see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the 
 end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of programming in S
 pring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendous benefit
 s they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge yo
 u gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with coroutines the ve
 ry next day.\n

 its nature\, performing any necessary processing\, and presenting the resu
 lts to their team or stakeholders as a report or chart.\n\nIn this worksho
 p\, you’ll learn how to build data processing pipelines in your applicatio
 ns. We’ll explore the best practices for extracting data from various sour
 ces\, aggregating and transforming it\, and then exporting it as a collect
 ion of data classes\, displaying it as tables\, or visualizing it with ins
 ightful charts.\n\nBy the end of the workshop\, you’ll be able to:\n\n- Lo
 ad\, transform\, and export data using the Kotlin DataFrame library.\n- Vi
 sualize data with the Kandy library to effectively convey insights.\n- Acc
 ess and manipulate data from various sources: REST APIs\, SQL databases\, 
 CSV files\, and other tabular data.\n- Handle both flat and hierarchical J
 SON-like data structures.\n- Boost your code written with the help of the 
 kotlin.collections or SQL-like frameworks.\n- Solve practical problems by 
 applying your skills to three real-world scenarios.\n- Present the insight
 s in Kotlin notebooks and easily share them on GitHub Gists.\n

SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 4. [Workshop\
 , Intermediate]
DESCRIPTION:\n                        Speakers:\n                            
 Urs Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains certified Kot
 lin Trainer \n\n                        <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/sc
 hedule/?session=da24d180-80f9-5efd-b2b8-cfca6f06af13">link</a>\n\n                        
 If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, h
 igh-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way around virtual 
 threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t ge
 t you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operations\, and We
 bFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, 
 parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headaches due to i
 ts complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe out all the 
 downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of virtual thre
 ads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking reactive ch
 aracteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will exp
 lore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, an
 d apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in Spring Boot 
 from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux 
 and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API calls using Web
 Client or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, either via 
 the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply structured concu
 rrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in parallel.\n- Creat
 e an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that combines corout
 ines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads in-depth a
 nd see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the 
 end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of programming in S
 pring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendous benefit
 s they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge yo
 u gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with coroutines the ve
 ry next day.\n

 nant\, multi-channel enterprise application for multiple European countrie
 s with a new and non-deterministic technology such as LLMs?\n\nThis is the 
 question my team and I asked ourselves over a year and a half ago.\n\nJoin 
 me in my talk to discover how we helped build one of Europe's biggest LLM 
 chatbots and how this led to Arc\, an open-sourced Kotlin-based AI framewo
 rk that is now part of the Eclipse Foundation.\n\nWhat makes Arc interesti
 ng is how it combines Kotlin DSL and scripting to enable developers to bui
 ld LLM-powered agents fast and efficiently\, and most importantly\, ready 
 for the enterprise.\n\nIn this session\, we will go through the journey of 
 how and why the framework was born.\n\nWe'll take a look at some of the de
 sign decisions that were made and some of the key features of the framewor
 k\, such as observability\, memory\, and tools\, highlighting how we tackl
 e some of our biggest challenges.\n\nAt the end of this session\, you shou
 ld have a good understanding of the challenges in building an LLM applicat
 ion at this scale\, as well as some strategies for solving these problems.

 more and more attention in modern programming\, making code easier to reas
 on about\, safer in concurrent environments\, and more maintainable. Howev
 er\, adopting immutability isn’t without challenges\, as it does improve t
 he developer experience\, but can often come with runtime costs. In Kotlin
 \, immutability is already a key part of the language design\, but there’s 
 significant potential to push its boundaries even further.\n\nThis talk be
 gins by exploring the current state of immutability in Kotlin. We’ll highl
 ight what features the language already provides\, examine what’s missing\
 , and discuss the reasons behind these design decisions. From there\, we’l
 l take a closer look at Project Valhalla\, an upcoming JVM initiative that 
 introduces value types and other innovations\, enabling new possibilities 
 for Kotlin. We’ll discuss how Valhalla can help enhance Kotlin’s immutabil

 developer uses AndroidX libraries. With KMP\, the usage is expanding to ot
 her platforms as well. The wide adoption makes API design and evolution of 
 these libraries critical for the user experience. Join me to learn about t
 he life of an API in AndroidX: from an idea\, to a design\, to a review\, 
 and through an API evolution. You will hear about our API review process a
 nd our use of Metalava and Kotlin Binary Compatibility Verification tools  
 to wrangle JVM\, Android\, and KMP libraries.\n

 implicity remains crucial to developer experience.\n\nIn this talk\, we'll 
 explore how http4k extends HTTP's capabilities through WebSocket and Serve
 r-Sent Events support and how these protocols can be modelled as simple fu
 nctions\, making them as testable as plain HTTP endpoints. We'll then show 
 how these streaming capabilities open up new possibilities for server-side 
 rendering\, bringing us full circle from the days of JSP to modern reactiv
 e interfaces - all while keeping the complexity on the server where it bel
 ongs.\n\nJoin us to discover how http4k's streaming capabilities can enhan

 us – an idea strikes for a side project and you want to build a quick weba
 pp\, but then you remember the state of webdev is still a bit of a mess in 
 2025. Sure you could pick up one of those "all-in-one" frameworks\, but th
 ey're so heavy and complicated. And even if that worked\, you'd still need 
 something on the frontend so you start looking at the the weird world of f
 rontend frameworks or (gasp!) writing raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n\nBut it d
 oesn't have to be that hard! I'm here to present a straightforward stack t
 hat gets you a full stack webapp up and running fast\, using the one langu
 age we all know and love – Kotlin. Database manipulation\, async services\
 , and a high fidelity UI\, all accessed and built with Kotlin. And yes\, y
 ou read that right – you can have a great UI without having to write a sin
 gle line of CSS\, HTML\, or JavaScript.\n\nI'll show you a path for buildi
 ng a basic webapp on top of a simple database (Postgres)\, performing basi
 c CRUD operations on that database (Kotlin Exposed)\, building business lo
 gic via async services (Kotlin Coroutines)\, and constructing a high-fidel
 ity UI to bring it all together (Vaadin on Kotlin). By the end of the talk 
 we'll have a fully functional webapp that is entirely built on Kotlin.\n\n
 And let's not forget\, we're not building a by-the-book\, very serious web
 app\, just something we're doing on the side for fun. So forget about test
 s and forget about perfect architecture – let's have some fun\, learn a fe
 w things along the way\, and get this thing running!\n

 enueCat SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform allows you to write your subscription 
 code once and run it on both Android and iOS. But how did we build it? We 
 have existing native SDKs for both Android and iOS\, and did not want to r
 ewrite all core logic. This talk will cover the strategies\, pitfalls and 
 learnings of our approach to bringing native SDKs to Kotlin Multiplatform.

 an integral part of a developer’s experience with the Kotlin programming l
 anguage. Areas like UI development (Jetpack Compose)\, backend development 
 (Spring Boot / Kotlin Serialization)\, and even testing (Power-Assert) all 
 leverage compiler plugins. But what is a Kotlin compiler plugin and what c
 an it do? Let’s learn by writing one!\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll discuss use 
 cases for compiler plugins and learn how they integrate with the Kotlin co
 mpiler. Then we’ll explore everything related to how code is represented w
 ithin the Kotlin compiler\, including how to inspect\, navigate\, transfor
 m\, and create these representations. When we’re done\, we’ll have written 
 a compiler plugin from scratch which can navigate the project code\, inspe
 ct annotations\, generate boilerplate\, and even report errors!\n

 nner is essential for saving system resources. Since coroutines and flows 
 are the recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android\, the
 re are APIs that do most of the heavy-lifting work for you. Namely: repeat
 OnLifecycle\, flowWithLifecycle\, and Compose’s collectAsStateWithLifecycl
 e. When building for Android\, you should include these libraries in your 
 toolbox. But even if you’re doing KMP\, you should keep this in mind.\n\nI
 n this talk\, we’ll see the different lifecycle-aware coroutines APIs\, th
 e problems they solve\, and which types of flows can make your system wast
 e resources—Disclaimer! A cold flow backed by a Channel or Flow operators 
 with buffers might be under investigation. Prepare to roll up your sleeves 
 as we dissect their implementation details and learn low-level coroutines 
 and Compose APIs. But the journey doesn't end there! To help you think as 
 a library developer\, we’ll explore an API regret that never made it into 
 stable to protect developers from misusing the API and force them respect 
 coroutines’ structure concurrency.\n\nBy the end of the talk\, you'll unde
 rstand the importance of collecting in a lifecycle-aware manner\, use low-
 level coroutines APIs to build your own APIs\, and design APIs that respec
 t structure concurrency and protect your users from misuse.\n

 siness rule-set problem? You know the kind where you have business rules (
 logic) spread across multiple platforms\, systems and applications? Some o
 f them might even be alter egos of the same rule hiding in different apps. 
 You never know which one might turn up where\, there is no single source o
 f truth\, solving errors takes hours of debugging\, and making changes req
 uires (oftentimes) painful coordination across teams and applications (ugh
 ).\n\nWe faced this exact challenge at Posten Bring As - Norwegian Nationa
 l Postal Service founded way back in 1647 - a 377-year-old institution wit
 h software spanning more generations than most families! Our business logi
 c was scattered across multiple platforms\, some almost as old as the comp
 any itself (well\, not quite\, but it sure felt like it).\n\nIn my session 
 I’m spilling the tea. We discover how the team at century-old Norwegian po
 stal services giant tackled modern challenges with cutting-edge technology
 .\n\nWe’ll look through real-world use cases at Posten Bring. We’ll reflec
 t on what we did - key learnings\, what went well and most importantly - w
 hat didn’t quite go as planned. We’ll also look through some resources to 
 get started. We'll learn how KMP provides a unified framework for code sha
 ring and execution across various platforms to solve the challenge of diff
 erent codebases targeting different runtimes.\n\nThis talk is for you if t
 roublesome and unruly business logic keeps you up at night and you want th
 at to end NOW. It is also for you if you like to hear a good story.\n

 7ab62f2e0823">link</a>\n\n                        Kotlin programmers regul
 arly elide uninformative types from their programs. This makes Kotlin prog
 rams faster to develop\, easier to read\, and less effort to maintain. It 
 also means the Kotlin language needs to be designed so that its compilers 
 can reliably accept programs without these typing hints. We think of this 
 as type-inference\, but—by definition—type-inference means determining the
 se missing types can be filled in such that the program type-checks.\n\nBu
 t what if we can determine a program is safe without determining these mis
 sing types? What if we can do so even when it such types do not exist? And 
 what if we can do so more efficiently than any type-inference algorithm ca
 n?\nIn researching Kotlin's next-generation typing algorithms\, we have di
 scovered we can efficiently exceed the capabilities of type-inference and 
 type-checking. We have developed a type-"outference" algorithm that effici
 ently decides "type-consistency"\, which all type-inferable/checkable prog
 rams satisfy (but not vice versa).\n\nWhile type-inference still has its p
 lace in user feedback and compilation\, type-consistency is a much more fl
 exible property\, and type-outference offers clear guidelines on how to de
 sign features for efficient validation. In this talk\, after introducing t
 hese concepts\, we will provide a behind-the-scenes look into how they gui
 de the design of various expected and hypothetical features for Kotlin\, s
 uch as union types for errors\, conditional inheritance for type-safe equa
 lity with value types\, and implicit polymorphism for non-escaping referen
 ces.\n

 cess library that provides a type-safe SQL DSL\, a powerful ORM\, and reli
 able database interactions as a seamless extension of any Kotlin developer
 ’s code.\n\nThe team behind the library has been working towards its first 
 stable version and recently published a beta release. This talk aims to pr
 ovide a detailed insight into what stability will mean for the library\, a
 s well as to highlight the enhanced features that have been implemented ov
 er time.\n\nWe’ll also cover the introduction of support for non-blocking 
 database operations using R2DBC with Kotlin coroutines\, as well as the ch
 allenges encountered during its development.\n\nLastly\, to share a look i
 nto the future of Exposed\, we’ll touch on planned features for later stab
 le versions\, like integrated support for database migrations\, which addr
 ess the library’s position as a database access solution in Kotlin Multipl
 atform development.\n

 es our job easier. Most people know that both products are built on the In
 telliJ Platform\, the same that underpins the popular IDEs from JetBrains\
 , which has seen lasting success for over 20 years. It’s a solid\, expansi
 ve\, and by far the best foundation on which we could stand on to deliver 
 developer goodies.\n\nHowever\, some parts of the IntelliJ Platform show t
 he signs of time\; in particular its UI framework\, Swing\, is proving the 
 most limiting\, having been around for almost 30 years. Don’t get us wrong 
 — it works\, and the IDEs themselves prove you can ship complex UIs by usi
 ng Swing on the IntelliJ Platform. But as we looked at how nice it is to d
 evelop UIs on desktop by using Compose for Desktop\, we thought: why don’t 
 we do the same?\n\nEnter Project Sparkles\, which aims at gradually introd
 ucing new high-quality\, polished UI surfaces in Android Studio and Intell
 iJ\, developed in Compose for Desktop\, with all the bells and whistles yo
 u can expect from a top-tier interface. In this talk\, we’ll cover how Pro
 ject Sparkles is impacting the development of Android Studio and IntelliJ\
 , addressing long-standing user feedback\, and how Google and JetBrains ar
 e working together to build a framework to make your favorite IDE even bet
 ter and easier to understand.\n\nWe’ll demonstrate a few examples of featu
 res already shipping that are powered by Project Sparkles\, explain what o
 ur goals and ambitions are\, and even show some sneak peeks of things you 
 may see in a future IDE version. We will also cover a roadmap on when deve

 ontinuous data streams and deliver real-time insights has become crucial i
 n modern application architectures. As a developer you are probably very c
 omfortable with RESTful services\, and shifting to event-driven thinking o
 pens new possibilities for responsiveness and scalability (as well as new 
 challenges and growing paints).\n\nThis talk will explore building real-ti
 me analytics dashboards by combining Apache Flink's powerful stream proces
 sing capabilities with Ktor's flexible web framework. We'll journey throug
 h the mental model transformation from request/response patterns to contin
 uous event flows\, demonstrating how this shift enables truly reactive app
 lications.\n\nYou'll learn:\n* How Apache Flink handles stateful stream pr
 ocessing\, offering advantages for complex analytics use cases\n* Leveragi
 ng Flink's Table API and SQL capabilities to express complex transformatio
 ns with familiar syntax\n* Implementing real-time dashboards with Ktor and 
 other Kotlin libraries\n\nBy the end of this session\, you'll understand h
 ow to bridge the gap between powerful backend stream processing and engagi
 ng user interfaces\, all while staying in the Kotlin ecosystem. Regardless
 \, if you're a seasoned data streaming engineer or just beginning to explo
 re beyond REST\, you'll bring home practical techniques for delivering rea
 l-time insights to your users.\n\n

 Q: Why should I care about Java nullness annotations?\n\nA: Because they’l
 l make Kotlin code that uses Java libraries safer\, and because they’ll ma
 ke it easier to convert Java code to Kotlin.\n\nJSpecify released a set of 
 nullness annotations for Java in July. Unlike all the other nullness annot
 ations for Java\, JSpecify’s are defined by tool-agnostic specification. T
 hat means that all the Java nullness analyzers will agree on what they mea
 n\, and the Kotlin compiler will too. And that means that your Kotlin code 
 will be able to use null-safe types instead of platform types when it depe
 nds on well-annotated Java libraries.\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll explain how 
 Java nullness annotations will help you\, and how JSpecify’s work. We’ll a
 lso tease upcoming projects that aren’t about nullness but might help your 
 Kotlin code too.\n\n\n

 nalysis in finance has a large literature already present in R and Python\
 , two of the most common suspects. They have the community\, tooling and a 
 long tradition. But what about Kotlin with some of the libraries in the fa
 mily\, like DataFrame and Kandy? Kotlin\, traditionally known for its focu
 s in mobile and backend development\, has emerged as a strong contender in 
 the data science space. This session explores the potential of Kotlin for 
 financial data analysis\, focusing on the use of the DataFrame library and 
 the Kandy visualization framework.\n\nWe will demonstrate how Kotlin provi
 des a rich\, statically typed language environment\, ensuring safety\, con
 ciseness\, and performance in handling large datasets commonly encountered 
 in financial contexts. DataFrame provides the capacity to manipulate struc
 tured data\, while Kandy enables high-quality visualizations.\n\nThis pres
 entation will also provide a comparative analysis between Kotlin\, R\, and 
 Python. We will examine common use cases such as dividend history\, stock 
 valuation based on price and yields. While R and Python have established e
 cosystems for data science\, Kotlin's performance\, tooling\, and modern f
 eatures offer new possibilities for finance professionals looking for a mo
 re efficient alternative.\n\n\n\n

 <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/schedule/?session=95166f14-ab8f-5ecc-a7c2-
 7fccda4058ab">link</a>\n\n                        Being a full-stack devel
 oper is valuable in today's tech landscape - you can own features end-to-e
 nd\, make holistic architectural decisions\, and adapt quickly to changing 
 project needs. This versatility is especially crucial in smaller teams and 
 startups.\n\nHowever\, the role can be intimidating. The list of technolog
 ies one is expected to master is extensive: Kubernetes\, Postgres\, Kotlin
 \, Gradle\, Ktor\, React\, Remix\, Node.js\, and NPM. Even the most experi
 enced developers struggle to keep up with it all.\n\nPerhaps we should ste
 p back and examine this problem from a fresh perspective. Do we truly need 
 all these technologies? After all\, HTML and CSS remain relatively stable\
 , unlike frameworks that seem to change every six months.\n\nMany applicat
 ions don't require the complexity of a modern Javascript Single Page Appli
 cation (SPA). Everything eventually renders to HTML anyway! Using technolo
 gies like HTML\, CSS\, HTMX\, AlpineJS\, and Unpoly\, you can achieve 98% 
 of SPA functionality with minimal frontend code and less complexity. These 
 tools enhance and build upon HTML and CSS rather than trying to replace th
 em.\n\nIn this presentation\, I'll show how HTMX and kotlinx.html combine 
 beautifully with Ktor to create modern\, interactive web applications. You
 'll see how these technologies work together seamlessly - Ktor's powerful 
 backend capabilities\, kotlinx.html's type-safe HTML generation\, and HTMX
 's elegant approach to frontend interactions. This stack offers a refreshi
 ngly simple way to build dynamic web applications while keeping your codeb
 ase clean and maintainable.\n

 51d40b89">link</a>\n\n                        Working with maps in a Kotli
 n Multiplatform app can be tricky—different platform APIs\, inconsistent f
 eatures\, and duplicated code add unwelcome complexity. MapLibre Compose s
 implifies this process by providing a consistent\, declarative API built o
 n top of MapLibre and Compose Multiplatform.\n\nWe’ll use practical exampl
 es to explore the design and implementation of MapLibre Compose\, how it l
 everages the Compose runtime to declaratively express the powerful mapping 
 capabilities of MapLibre\, and how it uses Kotlin Multiplatform to help de
 velopers write map-based UI code once and run it seamlessly on Android\, i
 OS\, and beyond without code duplication.\n\nFor developers working with C
 ompose Multiplatform\, this talk will showcase how MapLibre Compose can he
 lp add mapping features to your apps. You'll gain a clear understanding of 
 its capabilities\, its design principles\, and how it can help you create 
 richer user experiences across platforms.\n

 Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and\, more recently\, Compose Multiplatform (CM
 P) have matured significantly in recent years and are gaining increasingly 
 widespread adoption. \n\nHowever iOS integration continues to present its 
 own set of challenges which also vary depending on the amount of UI code t
 hat's being shared. In this talk I'll use real world examples to outline a 
 variety of different UI and non-UI patterns I've applied over the last 5 y
 ears when using KMP and CMP on iOS.  \n\n

 nue to evolve\, serverless functions provide powerful ways to build and sc
 ale applications with reduced infrastructure concerns. However\, cloud-spe
 cific requirements often make it challenging to keep business logic portab
 le across different cloud providers. This session presents a variant of cl
 ean architecture designed to separate core business logic from cloud-speci
 fic code\, leveraging Kotlin’s capabilities along with Spring Cloud Functi
 on and headless Gradle modules.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll demonstrate how to 
 structure a Kotlin application for serverless using a simplified clean arc
 hitecture approach. This structure maintains cloud-agnostic business logic 
 while allowing platform-specific implementations for integration functiona
 lity like storage. By isolating business logic in headless modules\, devel
 opers can deploy the same core code across multiple cloud function provide
 rs such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.\n\nThrough live coding\, we’ll 
 explore practical techniques for building and deploying serverless applica
 tions with cloud-agnostic business logic. \nThis session is aimed at advan
 ced Kotlin developers interested in serverless architecture\, cloud flexib
 ility\, and clean architecture principles. \n

 programming language by Apple\, primarily used for building apps within th

 at the end of the previous year. The standout feature of the release is st
 rict concurrency mode\, which aims to prevent data races.\n\nIn this talk\
 , we will take a quick look at Swift actors and `async`/`await` features\, 
 which share a lot of similarities with Kotlin Coroutines. We will explore 
 what does Swift 6 do to prevent data races\, and\, perhaps\, discuss if we 
 can expect a similar feature in future versions of Kotlin.\n\nThe talk ass

 il\, discussing its benefits and how it scales in large\, modularized code
 bases. We'll explore how to leverage the strengths of each host platform w
 hile maximizing common Kotlin Multiplatform code. Since each codebase is u
 nique\, I'll demonstrate how we adapt the framework for our own internal u
 se cases at Amazon.\n
