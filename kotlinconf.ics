DESCRIPTION:\n                        Speakers:\n                        Ur

 If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, h
 igh-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way around virtual 
 threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t ge
 t you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operations\, and We
 bFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, 
 parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headaches due to i
 ts complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe out all the 
 downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of virtual thre
 ads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking reactive ch
 aracteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will exp
 lore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, an
 d apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in Spring Boot 
 from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux 
 and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API calls using Web
 Client or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, either via 
 the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply structured concu
 rrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in parallel.\n- Creat
 e an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that combines corout
 ines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads in-depth a
 nd see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the 
 end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of programming in S
 pring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendous benefit
 s they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge yo
 u gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with coroutines the ve
 ry next day.\n

 unctional styles of programming\, but what should we do when we have OO co
 de that should be functional? Refactor\, of course!\n\nIn this workshop\, 
 Nat and Duncan\, the authors of Java to Kotlin: A Refactoring Guidebook\, 
 take a web application and introduce techniques to gradually and safely mi
 grate the code to the functional style better suited to today’s architectu
 res. Topics include:\n\n- Thinking in a functional way – Data\, Calculatio
 ns\, and Actions\n- Migrating from mutable objects to immutable data class
 es\n- Converting business logic to a functional domain model\n- Where does 
 the state live? Functional core / imperative shell\n- Choosing between fun
 ctions and methods\n- Functional error handling\n- Expand and Contract ref
 actoring for safety over many commits\n

 learn everything you need to know about how to be productive with coroutin
 es in Kotlin. We’ll start with the basics of asynchronous programming\, it
 s differences from blocking code\, and the concepts of suspending function
 s and coroutines. We’ll explore coroutine contexts\, concurrent decomposit
 ion of work via deferreds\, and structured concurrency with coroutine scop
 es.\n\nThe second part of the workshop will be devoted to Kotlin Flows. We
 ’ll study how Kotlin Flows are designed on a basic level\, learn the diffe
 rence between hot and cold flows\, discuss their typical usage patterns\, 
 and explore how they incorporate ideas from reactive streams. To deepen ou
 r understanding\, we’ll also take a peek at some of the implementations be
 hind flows and collectors. Throughout\, we’ll see how they help you in wri
 ting safe and reliable concurrent systems\, and how modern applications ca
 n use them to work with asynchronous streams of data\, manage system state
 s\, and broadcast events.\n\nThrough this workshop\, you’ll enhance your c
 oroutines-related vocabulary\, understand how to spot and avoid common pro
 blems\, and be able to effectively and confidently use coroutines and flow
 s in your own projects.\n

SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 3. [Workshop\
 , Intermediate]
DESCRIPTION:\n                        Speakers:\n                        Ur
 s Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains certified Kotli
 n Trainer \n                        <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/schedu
 le/?session=f1e2f2f2-fbe4-583b-8b23-b4ad4584566b">link</a>\n                        
 If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, h
 igh-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way around virtual 
 threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t ge
 t you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operations\, and We
 bFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, 
 parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headaches due to i
 ts complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe out all the 
 downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of virtual thre
 ads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking reactive ch
 aracteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will exp
 lore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, an
 d apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in Spring Boot 
 from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux 
 and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API calls using Web
 Client or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, either via 
 the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply structured concu
 rrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in parallel.\n- Creat
 e an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that combines corout
 ines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads in-depth a
 nd see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the 
 end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of programming in S
 pring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendous benefit
 s they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge yo
 u gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with coroutines the ve
 ry next day.\n

 ts nature\, performing any necessary processing\, and presenting the resul
 ts to their team or stakeholders as a report or chart.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how to build data processing pipelines in your application
 s. We’ll explore the best practices for extracting data from various sourc
 es\, aggregating and transforming it\, and then exporting it as a collecti
 on of data classes\, displaying it as tables\, or visualizing it with insi
 ghtful charts.\n\nBy the end of the workshop\, you’ll be able to:\n\n- Loa
 d\, transform\, and export data using the Kotlin DataFrame library.\n- Vis
 ualize data with the Kandy library to effectively convey insights.\n- Acce
 ss and manipulate data from various sources: REST APIs\, SQL databases\, C
 SV files\, and other tabular data.\n- Handle both flat and hierarchical JS
 ON-like data structures.\n- Boost your code written with the help of the k
 otlin.collections or SQL-like frameworks.\n- Solve practical problems by a
 pplying your skills to three real-world scenarios.\n- Present the insights 
 in Kotlin notebooks and easily share them on GitHub Gists.\n

SUMMARY:Spring Boot With Coroutines and Virtual Threads. Part 4. [Workshop\
 , Intermediate]
DESCRIPTION:\n                        Speakers:\n                        Ur
 s Peter - Urs Peter Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains certified Kotli
 n Trainer \n                        <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/schedu
 le/?session=da24d180-80f9-5efd-b2b8-cfca6f06af13">link</a>\n                        
 If you want to get the most out of Spring Boot in terms of low latency\, h
 igh-throughput\, and resource efficiency\, there is no way around virtual 
 threads and/or reactive libraries like Webflux.\n\nHowever\, both won’t ge
 t you far: Virtual threads are limited to non-blocking operations\, and We
 bFlux — even though offering all reactive qualities\, like non-blocking\, 
 parallelism\, streaming\, etc. — will give you a lot of headaches due to i
 ts complexity\, bad readability\, and maintainability.\n\nIn this workshop
 \, you’ll learn how Spring Boot’s coroutine support will wipe out all the 
 downsides of the ‘raw’ WebFlux approach or the limitations of virtual thre
 ads and provide you with the best of both worlds: non-blocking reactive ch
 aracteristics without the complexity.\n\nDuring the workshop\, we will exp
 lore Kotlin’s reactive building blocks\, such as coroutines and flows\, an
 d apply them in Spring Boot. By building a non-blocking API in Spring Boot 
 from scratch\, you’ll learn how to:\n\n- Use coroutines on top of WebFlux 
 and/or virtual threads.\n- Perform non-blocking remote API calls using Web
 Client or RestClient.\n- Access a database in a reactive way\, either via 
 the R2DBC or JDBC\, including framework support.\n- Apply structured concu
 rrency in your business logic\, like requesting data in parallel.\n- Creat
 e an advanced streaming API based on ServerSentEvents that combines corout
 ines and flow.\n\nIn addition\, we will explore virtual threads in-depth a
 nd see how they can leverage the power of coroutines even more.\n\nAt the 
 end of the workshop\, you’ll know all the ins and outs of programming in S
 pring Boot with coroutines while having experienced the tremendous benefit
 s they offer over raw virtual threads or WebFlux.\n\nWith the knowledge yo
 u gain\, you can enlighten your Spring Boot project with coroutines the ve
 ry next day.\n

 multi-channel enterprise application for multiple European countries with 
 a new and non-deterministic technology such as LLMs?\n\nThis is the questi
 on my team and I asked ourselves over a year and a half ago.\n\nJoin me in 
 my talk to discover how we helped build one of Europe's biggest LLM chatbo
 ts and how this led to Arc\, an open-sourced Kotlin-based AI framework tha
 t is now part of the Eclipse Foundation.\n\nWhat makes Arc interesting is 
 how it combines Kotlin DSL and scripting to enable developers to build LLM
 -powered agents fast and efficiently\, and most importantly\, ready for th
 e enterprise.\n\nIn this session\, we will go through the journey of how a
 nd why the framework was born.\n\nWe'll take a look at some of the design 
 decisions that were made and some of the key features of the framework\, s
 uch as observability\, memory\, and tools\, highlighting how we tackle som
 e of our biggest challenges.\n\nAt the end of this session\, you should ha
 ve a good understanding of the challenges in building an LLM application a
 t this scale\, as well as some strategies for solving these problems.\n

 re and more attention in modern programming\, making code easier to reason 
 about\, safer in concurrent environments\, and more maintainable. However\
 , adopting immutability isn’t without challenges\, as it does improve the 
 developer experience\, but can often come with runtime costs. In Kotlin\, 
 immutability is already a key part of the language design\, but there’s si
 gnificant potential to push its boundaries even further.\n\nThis talk begi
 ns by exploring the current state of immutability in Kotlin. We’ll highlig
 ht what features the language already provides\, examine what’s missing\, 
 and discuss the reasons behind these design decisions. From there\, we’ll 
 take a closer look at Project Valhalla\, an upcoming JVM initiative that i
 ntroduces value types and other innovations\, enabling new possibilities f
 or Kotlin. We’ll discuss how Valhalla can help enhance Kotlin’s immutabili
 ty story and improve the programming experience without significant trade-
 offs.\n\nFinally\, we’ll explore the broader immutability design space for 
 Kotlin\, looking beyond Valhalla to imagine what future extensions could l
 ook like. We’ll discuss how new immutability features could integrate with 
 existing ones\, such as smart casts and coroutines\, while maintaining the 
 language’s pragmatic and developer-friendly nature.\n\nJoin this session t
 o discover how Kotlin can evolve its immutability story to better meet the 
 needs of modern developers\, combining practicality with innovation.\n

 through an API evolution. You will hear about our API review process and o

 >\n                        What if you could share a single codebase acros
 s Android\, iOS\, and Web without sacrificing platform-specific experience
 s? Is it even possible? At X (formerly Twitter)\, with a tiny developer te
 am\, we took the leap with Kotlin Multiplatform to entirely rebuild one of 
 our core features for our multi-million-user platform.\n\nIn this talk\, w
 e'll take you through the highs and lows of adopting Kotlin Multiplatform 
 in a real-world project. Learn about our development process\, the librari
 es that made our journey smoother\, and how we approached architecture\, n
 avigation\, dependency injection\, and UI for a consistent user experience 
 across platforms.\n\nWe'll share practical lessons\, the challenges we fac
 ed\, and how Kotlin Multiplatform transformed our cross-platform developme
 nt strategy. We'll also explore one of the biggest challenges: gaining buy
 -in from iOS and Web developers for Kotlin Multiplatform. We'll share how 
 we addressed their concerns and built strong collaboration across teams. W
 hether you're curious about Kotlin Multiplatform or seeking tips to enhanc
 e your implementation\, this talk is for you!\n\nJoin us to see how Kotlin 
 Multiplatform enabled us to ship faster and deliver a seamless experience\
 , even while tackling the complexities of building for millions of users w
 ith a small\, focused team.\n

 ity remains crucial to developer experience.\n\nIn this talk\, we'll explo
 re how http4k extends HTTP's capabilities through WebSocket and Server-Sen
 t Events support and how these protocols can be modelled as simple functio
 ns\, making them as testable as plain HTTP endpoints. We'll then show how 
 these streaming capabilities open up new possibilities for server-side ren

 – an idea strikes for a side project and you want to build a quick webapp\
 , but then you remember the state of webdev is still a bit of a mess in 20
 25. Sure you could pick up one of those "all-in-one" frameworks\, but they
 're so heavy and complicated. And even if that worked\, you'd still need s
 omething on the frontend so you start looking at the the weird world of fr
 ontend frameworks or (gasp!) writing raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n\nBut it do
 esn't have to be that hard! I'm here to present a straightforward stack th
 at gets you a full stack webapp up and running fast\, using the one langua
 ge we all know and love – Kotlin. Database manipulation\, async services\, 
 and a high fidelity UI\, all accessed and built with Kotlin. And yes\, you 
 read that right – you can have a great UI without having to write a single 
 line of CSS\, HTML\, or JavaScript.\n\nI'll show you a path for building a 
 basic webapp on top of a simple database (Postgres)\, performing basic CRU
 D operations on that database (Kotlin Exposed)\, building business logic v
 ia async services (Kotlin Coroutines)\, and constructing a high-fidelity U
 I to bring it all together (Vaadin on Kotlin). By the end of the talk we'l
 l have a fully functional webapp that is entirely built on Kotlin.\n\nAnd 
 let's not forget\, we're not building a by-the-book\, very serious webapp\
 , just something we're doing on the side for fun. So forget about tests an
 d forget about perfect architecture – let's have some fun\, learn a few th
 ings along the way\, and get this thing running!\n

 better than could ever be produced by our will alone.” -- Donella Meadows\
 n\nRelational complexity in software is constantly increasing. Data pipeli
 nes become a mesh. A monoliths becomes microservices. Synchronous database 
 transactions become event-driven architectures. Infrastructure becomes Dev
 Ops. Software is becoming systems of software.\n\nAs technology profession
 als\, we are trapped between the desire for control and the reality of sys
 tems. Increasingly\, we act amidst ambiguity and uncertainty. We diversify 
 and expand our skillset.  Systems challenge our thinking patterns and core 
 mental models. \n\nFortunately\, there are some core principles for design
 ing healthy systems. I don't mean (strictly) scalability or microservices. 
 Three qualities are inherent in well-functioning systems: resilience\, sel
 f-organization and hierarchy. \n\nEach of the qualities\, guaranteed\, dif
 fer from your current definition. In this keynote\, we will explore them f
 rom a systems point of view.\n

 s essential for saving system resources. Since coroutines and flows are th
 e recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android\, there are 
 APIs that do most of the heavy-lifting work for you. Namely: repeatOnLifec
 ycle\, flowWithLifecycle\, and Compose’s collectAsStateWithLifecycle. When 
 building for Android\, you should include these libraries in your toolbox. 
 But even if you’re doing KMP\, you should keep this in mind.\n\nIn this ta
 lk\, we’ll see the different lifecycle-aware coroutines APIs\, the problem
 s they solve\, and which types of flows can make your system waste resourc
 es—Disclaimer! A cold flow backed by a Channel or Flow operators with buff
 ers might be under investigation. Prepare to roll up your sleeves as we di

 ness rule-set problem? You know the kind where you have business rules (lo
 gic) spread across multiple platforms\, systems and applications? Some of 
 them might even be alter egos of the same rule hiding in different apps. Y
 ou never know which one might turn up where\, there is no single source of 
 truth\, solving errors takes hours of debugging\, and making changes requi
 res (oftentimes) painful coordination across teams and applications (ugh).
 \n\nWe faced this exact challenge at Posten Bring As - Norwegian National 
 Postal Service founded way back in 1647 - a 377-year-old institution with 
 software spanning more generations than most families! Our business logic 
 was scattered across multiple platforms\, some almost as old as the compan
 y itself (well\, not quite\, but it sure felt like it).\n\nIn my session I
 ’m spilling the tea. We discover how the team at century-old Norwegian pos
 tal services giant tackled modern challenges with cutting-edge technology.
 \n\nWe’ll look through real-world use cases at Posten Bring. We’ll reflect 
 on what we did - key learnings\, what went well and most importantly - wha
 t didn’t quite go as planned. We’ll also look through some resources to ge
 t started. We'll learn how KMP provides a unified framework for code shari
 ng and execution across various platforms to solve the challenge of differ
 ent codebases targeting different runtimes.\n\nThis talk is for you if tro
 ublesome and unruly business logic keeps you up at night and you want that 
 to end NOW. It is also for you if you like to hear a good story.\n

SUMMARY:Designing Kotlin Beyond Type-Inference [Regular session\, Advanced\

 ss Tate - Programming-Languages Researcher and Consultant\n                        
 <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/schedule/?session=fd68ab16-799f-5136-85b8-
 7ab62f2e0823">link</a>\n                        Kotlin programmers regular
 ly elide uninformative types from their programs. This makes Kotlin progra
 ms faster to develop\, easier to read\, and less effort to maintain. It al
 so means the Kotlin language needs to be designed so that its compilers ca
 n reliably accept programs without these typing hints. We think of this as 
 type-inference\, but—by definition—type-inference means determining these 
 missing types can be filled in such that the program type-checks.\n\nBut w
 hat if we can determine a program is safe without determining these missin
 g types? What if we can do so even when it such types do not exist? And wh
 at if we can do so more efficiently than any type-inference algorithm can?
 \nIn researching Kotlin's next-generation typing algorithms\, we have disc
 overed we can efficiently exceed the capabilities of type-inference and ty
 pe-checking. We have developed a type-"outference" algorithm that efficien
 tly decides "type-consistency"\, which all type-inferable/checkable progra
 ms satisfy (but not vice versa).\n\nWhile type-inference still has its pla
 ce in user feedback and compilation\, type-consistency is a much more flex
 ible property\, and type-outference offers clear guidelines on how to desi
 gn features for efficient validation. In this talk\, after introducing the
 se concepts\, we will provide a behind-the-scenes look into how they guide 
 the design of various expected and hypothetical features for Kotlin\, such 
 as union types for errors\, conditional inheritance for type-safe equality 
 with value types\, and implicit polymorphism for non-escaping references.\

 in the room - setting up a Gradle project in a proper scalable way is hard
 . What’s even more challenging is doing this once the project is already s
 caled and running. What’s nearly impossible is learning what “a good scala
 ble setup” actually means on your own.\n\nSo what does a good scalable set
 up mean? Are the best practices universal for all types of project? Are th
 ere Kotlin specific best practices? When and how should you introduce them
 ? Let’s dive in!\n

 dio and IntelliJ every day\, and appreciate how its rich feature set makes 
 our job easier. Most people know that both products are built on the Intel
 liJ Platform\, the same that underpins the popular IDEs from JetBrains\, w
 hich has seen lasting success for over 20 years. It’s a solid\, expansive\
 , and by far the best foundation on which we could stand on to deliver dev
 eloper goodies.\n\nHowever\, some parts of the IntelliJ Platform show the 
 signs of time\; in particular its UI framework\, Swing\, is proving the mo
 st limiting\, having been around for almost 30 years. Don’t get us wrong — 
 it works\, and the IDEs themselves prove you can ship complex UIs by using 
 Swing on the IntelliJ Platform. But as we looked at how nice it is to deve
 lop UIs on desktop by using Compose for Desktop\, we thought: why don’t we 
 do the same?\n\nEnter Project Sparkles\, which aims at gradually introduci
 ng new high-quality\, polished UI surfaces in Android Studio and IntelliJ\
 , developed in Compose for Desktop\, with all the bells and whistles you c
 an expect from a top-tier interface. In this talk\, we’ll cover how Projec
 t Sparkles is impacting the development of Android Studio and IntelliJ\, a
 ddressing long-standing user feedback\, and how Google and JetBrains are w
 orking together to build a framework to make your favorite IDE even better 
 and easier to understand.\n\nWe’ll demonstrate a few examples of features 
 already shipping that are powered by Project Sparkles\, explain what our g
 oals and ambitions are\, and even show some sneak peeks of things you may 
 see in a future IDE version. We will also cover a roadmap on when develope

 tinuous data streams and deliver real-time insights has become crucial in 
 modern application architectures. As a developer you are probably very com
 fortable with RESTful services\, and shifting to event-driven thinking ope
 ns new possibilities for responsiveness and scalability (as well as new ch
 allenges and growing paints).\n\nThis talk will explore building real-time 
 analytics dashboards by combining Apache Flink's powerful stream processin
 g capabilities with Ktor's flexible web framework. We'll journey through t
 he mental model transformation from request/response patterns to continuou
 s event flows\, demonstrating how this shift enables truly reactive applic
 ations.\n\nYou'll learn:\n* How Apache Flink handles stateful stream proce
 ssing\, offering advantages for complex analytics use cases\n* Leveraging 
 Flink's Table API and SQL capabilities to express complex transformations 
 with familiar syntax\n* Implementing real-time dashboards with Ktor and ot
 her Kotlin libraries\n\nBy the end of this session\, you'll understand how 
 to bridge the gap between powerful backend stream processing and engaging 
 user interfaces\, all while staying in the Kotlin ecosystem. Regardless\, 
 if you're a seasoned data streaming engineer or just beginning to explore 
 beyond REST\, you'll bring home practical techniques for delivering real-t

 Q: Why should I care about Java nullness annotations?\n\nA: Because they’l
 l make Kotlin code that uses Java libraries safer\, and because they’ll ma
 ke it easier to convert Java code to Kotlin.\n\nJSpecify released a set of 
 nullness annotations for Java in July. Unlike all the other nullness annot
 ations for Java\, JSpecify’s are defined by tool-agnostic specification. T
 hat means that all the Java nullness analyzers will agree on what they mea
 n\, and the Kotlin compiler will too. And that means that your Kotlin code 
 will be able to use null-safe types instead of platform types when it depe
 nds on well-annotated Java libraries.\n\nIn this talk\, we’ll explain how 
 Java nullness annotations will help you\, and how JSpecify’s work. We’ll a
 lso tease upcoming projects that aren’t about nullness but might help your 
 Kotlin code too.\n

 s in finance has a large literature already present in R and Python\, two 
 of the most common suspects. They have the community\, tooling and a long 
 tradition. But what about Kotlin with some of the libraries in the family\
 , like DataFrame and Kandy? Kotlin\, traditionally known for its focus in 
 mobile and backend development\, has emerged as a strong contender in the 
 data science space. This session explores the potential of Kotlin for fina
 ncial data analysis\, focusing on the use of the DataFrame library and the 
 Kandy visualization framework.\n\nWe will demonstrate how Kotlin provides 
 a rich\, statically typed language environment\, ensuring safety\, concise
 ness\, and performance in handling large datasets commonly encountered in 
 financial contexts. DataFrame provides the capacity to manipulate structur
 ed data\, while Kandy enables high-quality visualizations.\n\nThis present
 ation will also provide a comparative analysis between Kotlin\, R\, and Py
 thon. We will examine common use cases such as dividend history\, stock va
 luation based on price and yields. While R and Python have established eco
 systems for data science\, Kotlin's performance\, tooling\, and modern fea
 tures offer new possibilities for finance professionals looking for a more 
 efficient alternative.\n

 7fccda4058ab">link</a>\n                        Being a full-stack develop
 er is valuable in today's tech landscape - you can own features end-to-end
 \, make holistic architectural decisions\, and adapt quickly to changing p
 roject needs. This versatility is especially crucial in smaller teams and 
 startups.\n\nHowever\, the role can be intimidating. The list of technolog
 ies one is expected to master is extensive: Kubernetes\, Postgres\, Kotlin
 \, Gradle\, Ktor\, React\, Remix\, Node.js\, and NPM. Even the most experi
 enced developers struggle to keep up with it all.\n\nPerhaps we should ste
 p back and examine this problem from a fresh perspective. Do we truly need 
 all these technologies? After all\, HTML and CSS remain relatively stable\
 , unlike frameworks that seem to change every six months.\n\nMany applicat
 ions don't require the complexity of a modern Javascript Single Page Appli
 cation (SPA). Everything eventually renders to HTML anyway! Using technolo
 gies like HTML\, CSS\, HTMX\, AlpineJS\, and Unpoly\, you can achieve 98% 
 of SPA functionality with minimal frontend code and less complexity. These 
 tools enhance and build upon HTML and CSS rather than trying to replace th
 em.\n\nIn this presentation\, I'll show how HTMX and kotlinx.html combine 
 beautifully with Ktor to create modern\, interactive web applications. You
 'll see how these technologies work together seamlessly - Ktor's powerful 
 backend capabilities\, kotlinx.html's type-safe HTML generation\, and HTMX
 's elegant approach to frontend interactions. This stack offers a refreshi
 ngly simple way to build dynamic web applications while keeping your codeb
 ase clean and maintainable.\n

 iplatform app can be tricky—different platform APIs\, inconsistent feature
 s\, and duplicated code add unwelcome complexity. MapLibre Compose simplif
 ies this process by providing a consistent\, declarative API built on top 
 of MapLibre and Compose Multiplatform.\n\nWe’ll use practical examples to 
 explore the design and implementation of MapLibre Compose\, how it leverag
 es the Compose runtime to declaratively express the powerful mapping capab
 ilities of MapLibre\, and how it uses Kotlin Multiplatform to help develop
 ers write map-based UI code once and run it seamlessly on Android\, iOS\, 
 and beyond without code duplication.\n\nFor developers working with Compos
 e Multiplatform\, this talk will showcase how MapLibre Compose can help ad
 d mapping features to your apps. You'll gain a clear understanding of its 
 capabilities\, its design principles\, and how it can help you create rich
 er user experiences across platforms.\n

 Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and\, more recently\, Compose Multiplatform (CM
 P) have matured significantly in recent years and are gaining increasingly 
 widespread adoption. \n\nHowever iOS integration continues to present its 
 own set of challenges which also vary depending on the amount of UI code t
 hat's being shared. In this talk I'll use real world examples to outline a 
 variety of different UI and non-UI patterns I've applied over the last 5 y
 ears when using KMP and CMP on iOS.\n

 e to evolve\, serverless functions provide powerful ways to build and scal
 e applications with reduced infrastructure concerns. However\, cloud-speci
 fic requirements often make it challenging to keep business logic portable 
 across different cloud providers. This session presents a variant of clean 
 architecture designed to separate core business logic from cloud-specific 
 code\, leveraging Kotlin’s capabilities along with Spring Cloud Function a
 nd headless Gradle modules.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll demonstrate how to stru
 cture a Kotlin application for serverless using a simplified clean archite
 cture approach. This structure maintains cloud-agnostic business logic whi
 le allowing platform-specific implementations for integration functionalit
 y like storage. By isolating business logic in headless modules\, develope
 rs can deploy the same core code across multiple cloud function providers 
 such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.\n\nThrough live coding\, we’ll exp
 lore practical techniques for building and deploying serverless applicatio
 ns with cloud-agnostic business logic. \nThis session is aimed at advanced 
 Kotlin developers interested in serverless architecture\, cloud flexibilit
 y\, and clean architecture principles.\n
